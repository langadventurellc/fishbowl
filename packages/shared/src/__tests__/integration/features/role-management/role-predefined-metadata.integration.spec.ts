/**
 * @fileoverview Role Metadata Validation and Service Coordination Integration Tests
 *
 * Integration tests focusing on role metadata validation and service coordination
 * between RoleService, FileService, and ValidationService. Tests verify that role
 * metadata (capabilities, constraints, descriptions) is properly validated,
 * accessible through service APIs, and that service coordination works correctly
 * with proper error propagation across service boundaries.
 *
 * Integration Strategy:
 * - Tests real internal service coordination between RoleService, FileService, ValidationService
 * - Uses temporary directories with realistic predefined role fixtures
 * - Mocks external dependencies (databases, external APIs, network calls)
 * - Follows BDD Given-When-Then structure with comprehensive scenarios
 * - Validates metadata accessibility and query operations through service APIs
 * - Tests cross-service error propagation with context preservation
