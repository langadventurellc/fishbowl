/**
 * @fileoverview Role Immutability Enforcement Integration Tests
 *
 * Integration tests focusing on predefined role immutability enforcement through
 * service layer operations. Tests verify that predefined roles cannot be modified
 * through service operations and that immutability constraints are properly enforced
 * at the service layer with appropriate error responses and business rule explanations.
 *
 * Integration Strategy:
 * - Tests real internal service coordination between RoleService, FileService, ValidationService
 * - Uses temporary directories with realistic predefined role fixtures
 * - Mocks external dependencies (databases, external APIs, network calls)
 * - Follows BDD Given-When-Then structure with comprehensive immutability scenarios
 * - Validates error handling and business rule enforcement for immutability violations
 * - Tests consistency of immutability enforcement across all service modification methods
