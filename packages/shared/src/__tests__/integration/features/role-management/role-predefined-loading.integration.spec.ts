/**
 * @fileoverview Role Loading Integration Tests with File Service Coordination
 *
 * Integration tests focusing on predefined role loading functionality through
 * service layer coordination. Tests verify that all 10 predefined roles are
 * correctly loaded from files, parsed, validated, and made available through
 * service APIs with proper coordination between RoleService, FileService, and
 * ValidationService.
 *
 * Integration Strategy:
 * - Tests real internal service coordination between RoleService, FileService, ValidationService
 * - Uses temporary directories with realistic predefined role fixtures
 * - Mocks external dependencies (databases, external APIs, network calls)
 * - Follows BDD Given-When-Then structure with comprehensive scenarios
 * - Validates performance requirements (300ms for all roles, 50ms individual access)
 * - Tests error handling and graceful degradation scenarios
