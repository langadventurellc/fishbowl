 * @fileoverview Configuration Workflow Coordination Integration Tests
 *
 * Comprehensive BDD integration tests for advanced workflow coordination patterns

 * workflow scenarios that combine multi-service orchestration, communication patterns,
 * and system consistency into sophisticated workflow coordination capabilities.
 *
 * Tests are implemented in BDD red phase using it.skip() to define expected behavior
 * without implementation, focusing on comprehensive workflow coordination scenarios.
