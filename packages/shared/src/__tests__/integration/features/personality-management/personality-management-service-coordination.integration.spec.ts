/**
 * @fileoverview Personality Management Service Coordination Integration Tests
 *
 * Integration tests focusing on service layer coordination for personality management.
 * Tests verify cross-service communication, error propagation, transaction consistency,
 * and performance characteristics across PersonalityService, ValidationService, and PersistenceService.
 *
 * Integration Strategy:
 * - Tests real internal service coordination without external dependencies
 * - Validates cross-service error propagation and context preservation
 * - Verifies transaction-like behavior across multiple services
 * - Mocks external dependencies while testing internal service integration
