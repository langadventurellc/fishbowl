## Context

Based on feedback about hardcoded styling values throughout the settings section, we need to establish a design token foundation to replace magic numbers with consistent, maintainable variables.

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Create CSS variables file** for design tokens in `apps/desktop/src/styles/`
2. **Define token categories**:
   - Spacing tokens (modal dimensions, padding, margins, gaps)
   - Typography tokens (heading sizes, description text)
   - Layout tokens (navigation widths, content constraints)
   - Animation tokens (durations, easing)
   - Breakpoint tokens (responsive design)
   - Touch target tokens (accessibility minimums)

3. **Integration approach**:
   - Use CSS custom properties that work with Tailwind CSS
   - Create utility classes or extend Tailwind config as needed
   - Ensure tokens are accessible in both CSS and React components

## Technical Approach

1. Research existing design token patterns in the codebase
2. Create `design-tokens.css` with organized variable definitions
3. Import tokens into main CSS file
4. Document token usage patterns for team reference

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design tokens CSS file created with organized categories
- [ ] Token naming follows consistent convention (e.g., `--dt-spacing-modal-width`)
- [ ] Tokens are accessible in Tailwind classes and CSS
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples and guidelines
- [ ] Foundation supports all identified hardcoded value categories
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing styling

## Security Considerations

- Ensure no hardcoded sensitive values are exposed in design tokens

## Testing Requirements

- Verify tokens render correctly in development environment
- Test token inheritance and CSS custom property support
- Validate no visual regressions in existing components

### Log

**2025-07-30T18:24:21.626973Z** - Implemented comprehensive design token foundation system for desktop settings with organized categories (spacing, typography, layout, animation, breakpoints, accessibility). Created CSS variables file with 70+ tokens, integrated with existing Tailwind CSS v4 architecture, and provided complete documentation with usage guidelines. All tokens follow semantic naming convention (--dt-category-attribute-variant) and support both direct CSS usage and Tailwind utility integration. Foundation supports all identified hardcoded value categories without breaking existing styling. Includes comprehensive migration documentation and responsive design support.
