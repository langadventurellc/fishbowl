Install Electron dependencies and create basic infrastructure for the desktop application.

**Detailed Context:**
After removing Tauri, we need to set up Electron as the new desktop framework. This involves installing Electron dependencies, creating the main process entry point, and configuring the basic application structure.

**Reference Documentation:**
Use context7 MCP tool to research current Electron best practices for 2025, including:

- Latest Electron version and installation
- Security best practices for main/renderer process separation
- TypeScript configuration for Electron apps

**Specific Implementation Requirements:**

1. Install Electron dependencies in apps/desktop/package.json:
   - electron (main dependency)
   - electron-builder (for packaging)
   - @types/electron (TypeScript types)
2. Create Electron main process file (src/electron/main.ts)
3. Create preload script for secure IPC (src/electron/preload.ts)
4. Update package.json with Electron-specific configuration
5. Configure TypeScript for Electron environment

**Technical Approach:**

1. Add Electron dependencies to package.json
2. Create src/electron directory structure
3. Implement basic Electron main process:
   - Window creation
   - Application lifecycle management
   - Basic security configuration
4. Create preload script for renderer communication
5. Update tsconfig.json for Electron types
6. Add basic Electron app configuration

**File Structure to Create:**

```
apps/desktop/
  src/
    electron/
      main.ts         # Main process entry point
      preload.ts      # Preload script for secure IPC
```

**Detailed Acceptance Criteria:**

- Electron dependencies installed and listed in package.json
- Main process file creates and manages application window
- Preload script configured for secure renderer communication
- TypeScript compilation works with Electron types
- Basic application lifecycle events handled (ready, window-all-closed)
- Security best practices implemented (nodeIntegration: false, contextIsolation: true)
- Application can be started with electron command

**Dependencies on Other Tasks:**

- Must complete T-remove-tauri-dependencies-and before starting
- Provides foundation for T-create-electron-hello-world

**Security Considerations:**

- Implement context isolation and disable node integration in renderer
- Use preload script for secure IPC communication
- Configure Content Security Policy basics

**Testing Requirements:**

- Verify Electron app starts without errors
- Test window creation and basic functionality
- Confirm TypeScript compilation with Electron types

### Log

**2025-07-22T04:30:16.461947Z** - Successfully set up Electron application infrastructure with latest dependencies and security best practices. Implemented main process with secure window creation, preload script for safe IPC communication, and comprehensive build configuration. All TypeScript compilation works correctly, linting passes with only expected environment variable warnings, and the React app can successfully access Electron APIs through the secure context bridge.
