# Remove File System Implementation Detail Tests

## Context

Several test files focus on low-level file system operations and cross-platform compatibility that are implementation details rather than business requirements. The core need is "reliably store configurations," not handling every possible file system edge case.

## Files to Remove

### Cross-Platform File Operations

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-cross-platform.integration.spec.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-atomic-operations.integration.spec.ts`

### File Lifecycle Management

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-lifecycle.integration.spec.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-file-lifecycle.integration.spec.ts`

### File Validation Integration

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-validation-integration.integration.spec.ts`

## Tests That Focus On

- Cross-platform path handling (Windows vs Unix)
- Platform-specific file permissions
- Atomic file operations across platforms
- File locking mechanisms
- Temporary file naming conflicts
- Complex backup and recovery scenarios

## Keep Essential File Tests

Retain basic file storage tests that validate core functionality:

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-crud-cross-service.integration.spec.ts` (basic CRUD)
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-lifecycle-management.integration.spec.ts` (if focused on business logic)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All file system implementation detail tests are removed
- [ ] Basic file storage functionality tests remain
- [ ] Test suite runs without errors
- [ ] No broken imports or references

### Log

**2025-07-29T16:59:55.762009Z** - Successfully removed 5 file system implementation detail test files that focused on cross-platform compatibility, atomic operations, and file lifecycle management rather than business requirements. Maintained essential business logic tests for configuration CRUD operations and service coordination. Test suite integrity verified with no broken references. Quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking) all passed successfully.
