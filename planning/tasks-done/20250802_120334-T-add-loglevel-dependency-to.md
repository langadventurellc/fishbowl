## Add loglevel dependency to shared package

### Context

The structured logging system requires the `loglevel` library as its core dependency. This task involves adding the dependency to the shared package and ensuring it's properly configured for use across the monorepo.

### Implementation Requirements

1. Add `loglevel` version `^1.9.1` to the shared package dependencies
2. Verify the dependency is correctly installed and accessible
3. Update any necessary TypeScript configurations to recognize the loglevel types

### Technical Approach

1. Navigate to `packages/shared/`
2. Run `pnpm add loglevel@^1.9.1` to add the dependency
3. Verify installation by checking `package.json` and `node_modules`
4. Create a simple test import to ensure TypeScript recognizes the types
5. Run quality checks to ensure no issues

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `loglevel` dependency is added to `packages/shared/package.json` with version `^1.9.1`
- [ ] Dependency is properly installed in the shared package
- [ ] TypeScript recognizes loglevel types without errors
- [ ] `pnpm quality` passes without issues
- [ ] A simple test import compiles successfully

### Testing Requirements

- Create a temporary test file to verify the import works correctly
- Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds with the new dependency

### Log

**2025-08-02T17:03:34.262414Z** - Successfully added loglevel@^1.9.1 dependency to shared package with complete module setup, exports, and test coverage. The logger module provides a named logger instance ('fishbowl-shared') set to INFO level by default, with backward compatibility support. All quality checks pass and the dependency is ready for use across desktop and mobile applications.
