# Update BDD Specifications Document to Reflect Cleaned-Up Tests

## Context

After removing over-engineered test files, the BDD specifications document at `extracted-specifications/bdd-specifications.md` needs to be updated to reflect the cleaned-up test suite. This document should focus on essential business requirements rather than implementation details.

## Current Document Analysis

The current document contains specifications extracted from tests that were overly focused on:

- Service coordination infrastructure
- Performance micro-benchmarks
- Advanced psychology research features
- File system implementation details
- Complex error handling scenarios

## Tasks

### 1. Remove Over-Engineered Specifications

Remove or significantly simplify specifications related to:

#### Service Communication Infrastructure

- Circuit breaker pattern specifications
- Complex service coordination error propagation
- Message passing integrity validation
- Advanced workflow orchestration patterns

#### Performance Micro-Benchmarks

- Specific timing requirements (50ms, 100ms, 300ms, etc.)
- Individual service coordination timing validation
- Memory efficiency specifications
- Performance consistency requirements

#### Advanced Psychology Features

- Psychological research correlation validation
- Age-appropriate trait development patterns
- Cultural sensitivity specifications
- Statistical improbability detection

#### File System Implementation Details

- Cross-platform path handling specifications
- Platform-specific file permissions
- Atomic file operation requirements
- Complex backup and recovery scenarios

### 2. Focus on Core Business Requirements

Ensure the document emphasizes essential functionality:

#### Essential CRUD Operations

- Create, read, update, delete for agents, personalities, roles
- Basic data validation (trait ranges, required fields)
- Reference validation (personality/role ID existence)

#### Core Business Logic

- Agent configuration with personality and role selection
- Model configuration and provider selection
- Basic file storage and retrieval
- Essential error handling for user-facing operations

### 3. Update Test Categories

Reorganize specifications into business-focused categories:

- **Agent Configuration Management**
- **Personality System Validation**
- **Role System Management**
- **Configuration Storage**
- **Integration Testing**

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document reflects only essential business requirements
- [ ] Over-engineered specifications are removed
- [ ] Core functionality specifications remain clear and actionable
- [ ] Document structure focuses on user-facing functionality
- [ ] No references to deleted test files or removed features
