# Fix Form Input Reset Issue in React Hook Form Implementations

## Problem Summary

React Hook Form implementations in the codebase experience a critical UX issue where the **first user interaction with any form field** (typing in text input, moving sliders, etc.) causes the input to be immediately reset/cleared. After this initial reset, the form works normally for all subsequent interactions.

This issue manifests across all form elements:

- Text inputs (name field)
- Range sliders (Big Five personality traits, behavior sliders)
- Textareas (custom instructions)

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stems from **unsaved changes tracking logic** that uses `useEffect` hooks monitoring form state changes. The problem occurs when:

1. Form initializes with default values
2. User makes first input (triggers form state change)
3. `useEffect` monitoring form changes fires immediately
4. State update cycle occurs that interferes with user input
5. Form value gets reset to previous state
6. Subsequent interactions work normally

### Confirmed Problematic Patterns

These patterns cause the input reset issue:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC - Causes input reset
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = form.watch((data) => {
    const hasChanges = !isEqual(lastSavedData, data as FormData);
    setUnsavedChanges(hasChanges);
  });
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, [form, lastSavedData, setUnsavedChanges]);

// ALSO PROBLEMATIC - Causes input reset
useEffect(() => {
  setUnsavedChanges(form.formState.isDirty);
}, [form.formState.isDirty, setUnsavedChanges]);
```

### Current Temporary Fix

The issue has been temporarily resolved in `CreatePersonalityForm.tsx` by **disabling unsaved changes tracking entirely**, but this removes important UX functionality.

## Technical Context

### Affected Files

- **Primary**: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/CreatePersonalityForm.tsx`
- **Related**: Any other React Hook Form implementations with change tracking

### Technology Stack

- React 19.1 with TypeScript 5.8
- React Hook Form with Zod validation (`@hookform/resolvers/zod`)
- Zustand for state management
- shadcn/ui form components

### Current Form Architecture

```typescript
const form = useForm<PersonalityFormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(personalitySchema),
  defaultValues: {
    /* form defaults */
  },
  mode: "onChange",
});
```

### Dependencies

- `@fishbowl-ai/shared` package contains form types and validation schemas
- `useUnsavedChanges` hook from shared package connects to Zustand store
- Form integrates with modal navigation system

## Implementation Requirements

### Investigate Root Cause

1. **Form initialization timing**: Determine if form state monitoring starts before form is fully initialized
2. **State update cycles**: Identify which state updates cause input interference
3. **React Hook Form integration**: Check for conflicts with form mode, validation timing, or component lifecycle
4. **Zustand store interactions**: Verify if store updates interfere with form state

### Research Alternative Approaches

1. **Delayed tracking initialization**: Start monitoring changes only after form is stable
2. **Event-based tracking**: Use form submission/blur events instead of real-time watching
3. **Custom dirty state logic**: Implement change detection that doesn't interfere with input
4. **Form state isolation**: Separate user input handling from change tracking

### Testing Strategy

1. **Reproduction**: Create minimal test case that reproduces the input reset
2. **Isolation**: Test each monitoring approach separately
3. **Timing analysis**: Measure when form state changes occur relative to user input
4. **Cross-component**: Verify fix works across different form implementations

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality

- [ ] **No input reset**: First user interaction with any form field accepts input normally
- [ ] **Immediate responsiveness**: All form controls respond to user input without delay
- [ ] **Consistent behavior**: All form elements (text, sliders, textareas) work identically
- [ ] **No performance degradation**: Form interactions remain under 50ms response time

### Unsaved Changes Tracking (Restored)

- [ ] **Accurate detection**: System correctly identifies when form has unsaved changes
- [ ] **No false positives**: Clean form doesn't incorrectly show unsaved changes
- [ ] **State persistence**: Unsaved changes state survives component re-renders
- [ ] **Modal integration**: Unsaved changes properly integrate with navigation warnings

### Form State Management

- [ ] **Initialization stability**: Form state is fully stable before monitoring begins
- [ ] **Memory efficiency**: No memory leaks from form subscriptions or state tracking
- [ ] **Error handling**: Graceful handling of form state edge cases
- [ ] **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained throughout implementation

### Integration Testing

- [ ] **Modal navigation**: Unsaved changes warnings work when navigating between sections
- [ ] **Form submission**: Save/cancel actions work correctly with change tracking
- [ ] **Multiple forms**: Fix works across different form implementations in the codebase
- [ ] **Error scenarios**: Form handles validation errors without triggering input reset

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Investigation (30 minutes)

1. Create minimal reproduction case
2. Add logging to identify exact timing of state updates
3. Test different React Hook Form configurations
4. Document findings about root cause

### Phase 2: Solution Design (30 minutes)

1. Design approach that avoids input interference
2. Plan integration with existing unsaved changes system
3. Consider backwards compatibility with current form patterns
4. Review solution with form state management best practices

### Phase 3: Implementation (45 minutes)

1. Implement chosen solution in `CreatePersonalityForm.tsx`
2. Test thoroughly across all form interactions
3. Restore unsaved changes functionality
4. Verify no regressions in form behavior

### Phase 4: Validation (15 minutes)

1. Test form with rapid user interactions
2. Verify unsaved changes warnings work correctly
3. Check integration with modal navigation system
4. Validate TypeScript compilation and linting

## Security Considerations

- **Input validation**: Ensure fix doesn't bypass existing form validation
- **State integrity**: Maintain form state security during tracking changes
- **Memory safety**: Prevent potential memory leaks from event subscriptions

## Performance Requirements

- **Immediate response**: Form inputs must respond within 50ms
- **No blocking**: Change tracking must not block user interactions
- **Efficient monitoring**: Minimal overhead from unsaved changes detection
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of event subscriptions and state

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- Form state initialization and stability
- Unsaved changes detection accuracy
- State update timing and sequencing
- Memory leak prevention

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end form interaction workflows
- Modal navigation with unsaved changes
- Form submission with change tracking
- Cross-component form consistency

### Manual Testing Scenarios

- Rapid typing in text inputs
- Quick slider value changes
- Mixed input types in sequence
- Form navigation edge cases

## Success Metrics

- **Zero input resets** on first user interaction
- **100% unsaved changes detection** accuracy
- **Sub-50ms response time** for all form interactions
- **No memory leaks** after extended form usage

## Additional Context

- This pattern may affect other React Hook Form implementations in the codebase
- Solution should be documented for future form development
- Consider creating reusable hook for safe unsaved changes tracking

### Documentation Updates
