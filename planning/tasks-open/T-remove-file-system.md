# Remove File System Implementation Detail Tests

## Context

Several test files focus on low-level file system operations and cross-platform compatibility that are implementation details rather than business requirements. The core need is "reliably store configurations," not handling every possible file system edge case.

## Files to Remove

### Cross-Platform File Operations

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-cross-platform.integration.spec.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-atomic-operations.integration.spec.ts`

### File Lifecycle Management

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-lifecycle.integration.spec.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-file-lifecycle.integration.spec.ts`

### File Validation Integration

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-validation-integration.integration.spec.ts`

## Tests That Focus On

- Cross-platform path handling (Windows vs Unix)
- Platform-specific file permissions
- Atomic file operations across platforms
- File locking mechanisms
- Temporary file naming conflicts
- Complex backup and recovery scenarios

## Keep Essential File Tests

Retain basic file storage tests that validate core functionality:

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-crud-cross-service.integration.spec.ts` (basic CRUD)
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-lifecycle-management.integration.spec.ts` (if focused on business logic)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All file system implementation detail tests are removed
- [ ] Basic file storage functionality tests remain
- [ ] Test suite runs without errors
- [ ] No broken imports or references
