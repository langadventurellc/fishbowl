Perform final cleanup of any remaining Tauri references and verify the migration is complete.

**Detailed Context:**
After completing the main migration tasks, perform a thorough cleanup to ensure no Tauri artifacts, references, or dependencies remain in the codebase. This includes hidden files, cache directories, configuration remnants, and any code comments or references.

**Potential Remaining Artifacts:**
- Lock file entries (pnpm-lock.yaml)
- TypeScript import statements
- Configuration file references
- Code comments mentioning Tauri
- Environment variables or build artifacts
- IDE configuration files
- Git ignore entries specific to Tauri

**Specific Implementation Requirements:**
1. Comprehensive search for any remaining "tauri" references:
   - Case-insensitive search across all file types
   - Check hidden files and directories
   - Review lock files and cached dependencies
2. Clean TypeScript imports and type references
3. Update .gitignore if it contains Tauri-specific entries
4. Remove any Tauri-related environment variables
5. Verify all build and development commands work
6. Test complete development workflow end-to-end

**Technical Approach:**
1. Use ripgrep/grep to search entire codebase for case-insensitive "tauri"
2. Search for @tauri-apps references in any remaining files
3. Check pnpm-lock.yaml for any remaining Tauri dependencies
4. Review .gitignore for Tauri-specific exclusions
5. Test full development workflow:
   - Clean install (pnpm install)
   - Development mode (pnpm dev:desktop)
   - Build process (pnpm build:desktop)
   - E2E tests (pnpm test:e2e:desktop)
6. Document any issues or inconsistencies found

**Files and Directories to Check:**
- All source code files (.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx)
- Configuration files (.json, .toml, .yaml, .yml)
- Documentation files (.md)
- Package lock files (pnpm-lock.yaml)
- Hidden configuration files (.* files)
- IDE settings (.vscode/, .idea/)
- Environment files (.env*)

**Detailed Acceptance Criteria:**
- No case-insensitive matches for "tauri" in codebase (except this task description)
- No @tauri-apps dependencies in package files or lock files
- All TypeScript compilation passes without Tauri-related errors
- Complete development workflow works end-to-end:
  - Fresh install completes successfully
  - Development mode starts and shows Hello World
  - Build process produces working Electron application
  - E2E tests pass
- No broken import statements or missing type declarations
- .gitignore contains appropriate Electron-specific entries
- Git repository is clean with no uncommitted Tauri artifacts

**Dependencies on Other Tasks:**
- Should complete after all other migration tasks
- Serves as final verification step

**Security Considerations:**
- Ensure no Tauri security configurations are missed in cleanup
- Verify Electron security settings are properly configured
- Check that no sensitive Tauri-specific configurations remain

**Testing Requirements:**
- Full clean install and development workflow test
- Build verification on multiple platforms (if applicable)
- E2E test suite runs successfully
- No console errors or warnings related to missing Tauri dependencies
- Verify application functionality matches expected Hello World behavior
