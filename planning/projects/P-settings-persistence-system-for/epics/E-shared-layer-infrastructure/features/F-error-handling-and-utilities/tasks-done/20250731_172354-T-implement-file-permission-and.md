# Implement File Permission and Directory Utilities

## Context

Create file system utilities for checking and setting permissions, creating directories safely, and handling cross-platform file system operations for the persistence layer.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create

- `packages/shared/src/services/storage/utils/fileUtils.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/services/storage/utils/__tests__/fileUtils.test.ts`

### Technical Approach

Implement these utility functions working with the existing FileSystemBridge pattern:

**ensureDirectoryExists(dirPath: string, fs: FileSystemBridge): Promise<void>**

- Create directory and parent directories if they don't exist
- Handle race conditions with concurrent directory creation
- Use existing FileSystemBridge interface for operations
- Throw appropriate FileStorageError for failures

**checkFilePermissions(filePath: string, fs: FileSystemBridge): Promise<{ read: boolean; write: boolean }>**

- Check if file/directory has read and write permissions
- Return permission status object
- Handle cross-platform permission differences
- Use FileSystemBridge for file system access

**setFilePermissions(filePath: string, permissions: number, fs: FileSystemBridge): Promise<void>**

- Set file permissions using octal notation (e.g., 0o600)
- Handle cross-platform permission setting (Windows vs Unix)
- Validate permission values before setting
- Throw FileStorageError for permission failures

**getDirectoryStats(dirPath: string, fs: FileSystemBridge): Promise<{ exists: boolean; isDirectory: boolean; isWritable: boolean }>**

- Get comprehensive directory status information
- Check existence, type, and write permissions
- Return structured status object
- Handle non-existent paths gracefully

**createTempFile(basePath: string, prefix: string, fs: FileSystemBridge): Promise<string>**

- Create secure temporary file with unique name
- Use cryptographically secure random naming
- Set appropriate permissions (user-only access)
- Return full path to created temp file

## Acceptance Criteria

### Directory Management ✅ Must Implement

- ✅ Creates nested directories safely with proper error handling
- ✅ Handles concurrent directory creation without race conditions
- ✅ Works with existing FileSystemBridge abstraction
- ✅ Provides clear error messages for directory creation failures
- ✅ Validates directory paths using path utilities

### Permission Management ✅ Must Implement

- ✅ Accurately checks read/write permissions across platforms
- ✅ Sets file permissions using standard octal notation
- ✅ Handles Windows vs Unix permission model differences
- ✅ Validates permission values before application
- ✅ Provides meaningful error messages for permission failures

### Cross-Platform Support ✅ Must Implement

- ✅ Works correctly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ✅ Handles platform-specific permission behaviors
- ✅ Uses appropriate system calls through FileSystemBridge
- ✅ Accounts for filesystem-specific limitations

### Security Considerations ✅ Must Implement

- ✅ Creates temporary files with secure permissions (user-only)
- ✅ Validates paths to prevent directory traversal
- ✅ Uses cryptographically secure random naming for temp files
- ✅ Doesn't expose sensitive filesystem information in errors

### Integration Requirements ✅ Must Implement

- ✅ Uses existing FileSystemBridge interface consistently
- ✅ Integrates with FileStorageError hierarchy for error handling
- ✅ Works with path validation utilities
- ✅ Follows existing async/await patterns

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Must Cover

**Directory Management:**

- Creating new directories with nested paths
- Handling existing directories gracefully
- Concurrent directory creation scenarios
- Invalid directory paths and error handling
- Permission denied scenarios

**Permission Checking:**

- Files with various permission combinations
- Non-existent files and directories
- Read-only vs read-write access detection
- Cross-platform permission differences
- Permission denied scenarios

**Permission Setting:**

- Setting standard permissions (0o600, 0o644, 0o755)
- Invalid permission values
- Permission setting on read-only filesystems
- Cross-platform permission application
- Files vs directory permission handling

**Temporary File Creation:**

- Unique filename generation
- Secure permission setting (user-only)
- Multiple temp files in same directory
- Cleanup and error scenarios
- Invalid base paths

### Integration Tests

- Work correctly with existing FileSystemBridge implementations
- Error handling integrates with FileStorageError
- Path validation integration
- Cross-platform compatibility on CI systems

## Dependencies

- FileSystemBridge interface for all file system operations
- Path utilities for path validation and resolution
- FileStorageError hierarchy for consistent error handling
- Node.js crypto module for secure temp file naming

## File Locations

- Add to `packages/shared/src/services/storage/utils/`
- Follow existing patterns from FileStorageService
- Use FileSystemBridge pattern for all file system access
- Export from utils/index.ts barrel file

### Log

**2025-07-31T22:23:54.764134Z** - Implemented comprehensive file permission and directory utilities for the persistence layer. Created 5 separate utility functions following the project's one-export-per-file pattern: ensureDirectoryExists for safe directory creation with race condition handling, checkFilePermissions for cross-platform permission checking, setFilePermissions for octal permission setting, getDirectoryStats for comprehensive directory status, and createTempFile for secure temporary file creation with cryptographically secure naming. All functions integrate with the existing FileSystemBridge abstraction, use proper path validation and sanitization, implement consistent error handling via the FileStorageError hierarchy, and handle cross-platform differences gracefully. Added comprehensive test coverage with 398 total tests passing, including edge cases for Windows vs Unix permissions, concurrent operations, security validations, and error conditions.
