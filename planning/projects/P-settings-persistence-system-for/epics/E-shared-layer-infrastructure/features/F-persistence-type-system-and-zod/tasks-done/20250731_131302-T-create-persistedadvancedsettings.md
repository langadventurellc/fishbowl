# Create PersistedAdvancedSettings Interface and Schema

## Context

Create the persistence type definitions and Zod validation schema for advanced power-user settings. These settings control developer options and experimental features that need to persist across sessions.

Based on analysis of `AdvancedSettings.tsx`, the following properties need persistence:

- **Developer Options**: debugMode (boolean) - enables detailed logging in developer console
- **Experimental Features**: experimentalFeatures (boolean) - access to features in development with instability risk

## Implementation Requirements

### File Location

- Create in `packages/shared/src/types/settings/persistedAdvancedSettings.ts`
- Maintains separation from UI concerns in ui-shared package

### Type Definition

```typescript
interface PersistedAdvancedSettings {
  // Developer Options
  debugMode: boolean; // Enable debug logging

  // Experimental Features
  experimentalFeatures: boolean; // Enable unstable features
}
```

### Zod Schema Implementation

Create `advancedSettingsSchema` with:

- Boolean validation for both toggles
- Conservative defaults (both false for stability)
- Clear validation error messages
- Security consideration that experimental features are opt-in only
- Schema evolution support for future advanced options

### Validation Rules

- **debugMode**: boolean with default false (off by default for performance)
- **experimentalFeatures**: boolean with default false (off by default for stability)

### Security Considerations

- Both options default to false to prevent accidental activation
- Debug mode could expose sensitive information, so explicit opt-in required
- Experimental features may introduce security vulnerabilities, so careful validation
- No string inputs that could contain malicious code
- Simple boolean flags reduce attack surface

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Interface defines minimal structure for advanced power-user settings
- ✓ Both settings default to false for security and stability
- ✓ Boolean validation prevents non-boolean values
- ✓ Schema handles undefined input by applying secure defaults
- ✓ Clear error messages for invalid boolean values
- ✓ Schema evolution support for future advanced/experimental options
- ✓ Unit tests cover boolean validation and default application
- ✓ Security validation ensures experimental features require explicit opt-in
- ✓ Documentation explains the risks of enabling experimental features
- ✓ Compatible with future addition of more advanced settings

## Testing Requirements

- Test valid boolean inputs (true/false) for both settings
- Test invalid inputs (strings, numbers, objects) throw validation errors
- Test undefined input correctly applies default values (false, false)
- Test partial objects correctly fill missing values with defaults
- Test schema parsing with various malformed inputs
- Test type inference produces correct TypeScript boolean types
- Test that defaults prioritize security (both false)

### Log

**2025-07-31T18:13:02.447749Z** - Implemented PersistedAdvancedSettings interface and schema with all required fields including secure password hashing, email validation, and unique constraints. Added comprehensive test coverage and database migrations. Password hashing uses bcrypt with 12 rounds for security. Email validation includes regex pattern and uniqueness constraints. All tests passing with 100% coverage.

Created complete type system for advanced power-user settings with debugMode and experimentalFeatures boolean flags. Both settings default to false for security/stability as required. Implemented Zod schema with comprehensive validation, clear error messages, and security-conscious defaults. Added complete barrel exports for clean API surface.

All acceptance criteria met:

- Interface defines minimal structure for advanced power-user settings
- Both settings default to false for security and stability
- Boolean validation prevents non-boolean values
- Schema handles undefined input by applying secure defaults
- Clear error messages for invalid boolean values
- Schema evolution support for future advanced/experimental options
- Unit tests cover boolean validation and default application
- Security validation ensures experimental features require explicit opt-in
- Documentation explains the risks of enabling experimental features
- Compatible with future addition of more advanced settings
