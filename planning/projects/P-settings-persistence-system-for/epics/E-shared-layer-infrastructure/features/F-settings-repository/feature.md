# Settings Repository

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement the high-level repository pattern that coordinates between the file storage service and type system to provide a clean, validated API for loading and saving settings. This repository handles schema validation, default value application, data migration, and provides the main interface that UI layers will consume.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. SettingsRepository Class

- `loadSettings(): Promise<PersistedSettings>` method for retrieving all settings
- `saveSettings(settings: Partial<PersistedSettings>): Promise<void>` method for persisting changes
- `getDefaultSettings(): PersistedSettings` method for providing complete defaults
- `validateSettings(settings: unknown): PersistedSettings` method for validation and parsing
- Configuration for custom file paths and storage locations
- Automatic schema migration support for version upgrades

### 2. Repository Pattern Implementation

- Clean separation between data access logic and business logic
- Dependency injection support for file storage service
- Interface-based design for easy testing and mocking
- Consistent error handling and propagation
- Transaction-like behavior for atomic updates

### 3. Settings Management Features

- Partial updates that merge with existing settings
- Deep merge functionality for nested configuration changes
- Settings validation before persistence with detailed error reporting
- Automatic backup creation before destructive operations
- Graceful handling of missing or corrupted settings files

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Behavior

- ✓ `loadSettings()` returns complete settings object with all defaults applied
- ✓ `loadSettings()` creates default settings file if none exists
- ✓ `saveSettings()` merges partial updates with existing settings correctly
- ✓ `saveSettings()` validates all data before persistence using Zod schemas
- ✓ `getDefaultSettings()` returns complete default configuration instantly
- ✓ `validateSettings()` parses and validates unknown data into typed settings
- ✓ All methods handle missing files gracefully by applying defaults

### Data Validation and Schema Handling

- ✓ Invalid settings data triggers `SettingsValidationError` with detailed paths
- ✓ Missing required fields are filled with defaults during load operations
- ✓ Unknown fields in settings file are preserved for backward compatibility
- ✓ Schema version mismatches trigger appropriate migration logic
- ✓ Corrupted JSON files result in clean error with recovery suggestions
- ✓ Partial updates validate only modified fields, not entire object

### Settings File Management

- ✓ Settings file stored in predictable, configurable location
- ✓ File permissions set appropriately for user-only access
- ✓ Atomic updates prevent file corruption during save operations
- ✓ Automatic backup created before applying potentially destructive changes
- ✓ File format is human-readable JSON with proper indentation
- ✓ Large settings objects don't cause memory or performance issues

### Performance Requirements

- ✓ `getDefaultSettings()` returns immediately (no I/O operations)

### Error Handling and Recovery

- ✓ File system errors (permissions, disk full) propagate with clear context
- ✓ Validation errors include specific field paths and suggested fixes
- ✓ Corrupted settings files trigger fallback to defaults with user notification
- ✓ Network file system interruptions handled gracefully
- ✓ Concurrent access attempts handled safely without data loss

### Integration Requirements

- ✓ Exports clean interface for UI layers to consume
- ✓ No direct dependencies on UI packages (React, DOM, etc.)
- ✓ Works identically in Node.js and Electron environments
- ✓ Compatible with different file storage backends through abstraction
- ✓ Supports custom configuration paths for different deployment scenarios

## Implementation Guidance

### Repository Architecture

```typescript
export interface SettingsRepositoryInterface {
  loadSettings(): Promise<PersistedSettings>;
  saveSettings(settings: Partial<PersistedSettings>): Promise<void>;
  getDefaultSettings(): PersistedSettings;
  validateSettings(settings: unknown): PersistedSettings;
}

export class SettingsRepository implements SettingsRepositoryInterface {
  constructor(
    private fileStorage: FileStorageService,
    private settingsPath: string = "./preferences.json",
  ) {}

  async loadSettings(): Promise<PersistedSettings> {
    // Implementation with error handling and defaults
  }

  async saveSettings(settings: Partial<PersistedSettings>): Promise<void> {
    // Merge, validate, and persist implementation
  }
}
```

### Settings Merge Strategy

- Use deep merge for nested objects while preserving type safety
- Validate merged result before persistence
- Handle array updates (replace vs merge) based on setting type
- Preserve unknown fields for forward compatibility

### Migration and Versioning

- Include `schemaVersion` field in persisted settings
- Implement migration functions for each version transition
- Fall back to defaults for unrecognized versions
- Log migration operations for debugging

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing

- Load settings from valid file returns properly typed and validated data
- Load settings from missing file creates defaults and saves to disk
- Save settings merges partial updates correctly with existing data
- Validation catches all invalid data types and provides helpful errors
- Default settings provide complete, valid configuration
- Migration logic handles version upgrades correctly

### Integration Testing

- Repository works with actual file system through FileStorageService
- Concurrent access scenarios handled safely
- Error recovery works with real file system failures
- Memory usage remains stable under repeated operations

### Error Scenario Testing

- Corrupted JSON files handled gracefully
- Permission denied scenarios
- Disk full conditions during save operations
- Network interruptions on remote file systems
- Invalid partial update attempts

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**

- F-persistence-type-system-and-zod: Requires type definitions and Zod schemas for validation
- F-generic-file-storage-service: Requires file storage service for persistence operations

This feature provides the main API that the UI layers will consume for settings management.
