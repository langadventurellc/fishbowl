# Integrate useDesktopSettingsPersistence hook in GeneralSettings component

## Context

The GeneralSettings component currently has a TODO comment for integrating with the settings persistence system. We need to connect it to the desktop settings adapter using the `useDesktopSettingsPersistence` hook that was created in the previous feature.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Import Required Dependencies

- Import `useDesktopSettingsPersistence` from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
- Import `desktopSettingsAdapter` from `apps/desktop/src/adapters`

### 2. Integrate the Persistence Hook

- Replace the TODO comment in `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/GeneralSettings.tsx`
- Add the persistence hook near the top of the component:

```typescript
const { settings, saveSettings } = useDesktopSettingsPersistence({
  adapter: desktopSettingsAdapter,
  onError: (error) => {
    setSubmitError(error.message);
  },
});
```

### 3. Update Form Default Values

- Modify the form initialization to use loaded settings:

```typescript
const form = useForm<GeneralSettingsFormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(generalSettingsSchema),
  defaultValues: settings?.general || defaultGeneralSettings,
  mode: "onChange",
});
```

### 4. Add Effect to Reset Form When Settings Load

- Add a useEffect to update the form when settings are loaded:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (settings?.general) {
    form.reset(settings.general);
  }
}, [settings, form]);
```

### 5. Update Form Submission Handler

- Modify the `onSubmit` function to save through the persistence adapter:

```typescript
const onSubmit = useCallback(
  async (data: GeneralSettingsFormData) => {
    setSubmitError(null);

    try {
      const validatedData = generalSettingsSchema.parse(data);

      await saveSettings({
        ...settings,
        general: validatedData,
      });

      setUnsavedChanges(false);
      form.reset(validatedData);

      console.log("Settings saved successfully");
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handling already done by onError callback
    }
  },
  [form, setUnsavedChanges, settings, saveSettings],
);
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ GeneralSettings component uses useDesktopSettingsPersistence hook
- ✓ Form loads with saved settings values on mount
- ✓ Save button persists settings to local file
- ✓ Settings survive application restart
- ✓ Unsaved changes tracking works correctly
- ✓ Error handling displays appropriate messages
- ✓ No UI freezing during save operations

## Testing Requirements

Write unit tests to verify:

- Hook integration is set up correctly
- Form populates with saved settings
- Save operation updates the settings file
- Error callback is triggered on save failures
- Unsaved changes state is cleared after successful save

## File Locations

- Component to modify: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/GeneralSettings.tsx`
- Hook to use: from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
- Adapter to use: from `apps/desktop/src/adapters/desktopSettingsAdapter.ts`

### Log

**2025-08-03T02:20:31.184083Z** - Successfully integrated useSettingsPersistence hook in GeneralSettings component to enable persistent storage of user preferences. The integration includes:

1. **Hook Integration**: Replaced TODO comment with useSettingsPersistence hook using desktopSettingsAdapter
2. **Form Initialization**: Updated form defaultValues to use loaded settings with fallback to defaults
3. **Settings Loading**: Added useEffect to reset form when settings are loaded asynchronously
4. **Form Submission**: Modified onSubmit handler to save through persistence adapter with proper error handling
5. **Loading State**: Added loading UI during initial settings load to improve user experience
6. **Error Handling**: Integrated error callback to display save/load errors to users
7. **Testing**: Added comprehensive unit tests for persistence integration including loading states and hook usage

The implementation follows the established architecture patterns with proper separation of concerns between UI, type mapping, and persistence layers. Settings now load automatically when the component mounts, persist correctly when saved, and survive application restarts. All quality checks pass and tests verify the integration works correctly.
