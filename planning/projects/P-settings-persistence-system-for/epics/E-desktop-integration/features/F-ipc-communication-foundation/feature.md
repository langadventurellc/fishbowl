# IPC Communication Foundation

## Purpose and Functionality

Establish the minimal Inter-Process Communication (IPC) infrastructure needed for settings persistence operations between Electron's main and renderer processes. This feature implements a secure, type-safe communication channel that enables the renderer process to request settings operations from the main process, which has access to the file system.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. IPC Channel Definitions

- Define settings-specific IPC channel names as constants
- Create channels for: `settings:load`, `settings:save`, `settings:reset`
- Establish naming conventions for future channels

### 2. Main Process IPC Handlers

- Implement IPC handlers in the main process for settings operations
- Create a dedicated settings IPC module in `src/electron/ipc/settingsHandlers.ts`
- Register handlers on app initialization
- Ensure handlers are async and properly handle errors

### 3. Renderer Process API

- Extend the existing preload script to expose settings API
- Add typed methods to `window.electronAPI` for settings operations
- Implement proper error serialization for IPC boundary

### 4. Type Definitions

- Create shared types for IPC communication in `src/types/settingsIPC.ts`
- Define request/response types for each operation
- Ensure type safety across process boundaries

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✓ Main process can receive and handle settings IPC requests
- ✓ Renderer process can invoke settings operations via window.electronAPI
- ✓ All IPC channels follow consistent naming patterns
- ✓ Request/response cycle completes successfully
- ✓ Errors are properly serialized across IPC boundary

### Security Requirements

- ✓ IPC channels are scoped to settings operations only
- ✓ No arbitrary file system access exposed
- ✓ Input validation on main process handlers
- ✓ Context isolation maintained

### Integration Requirements

- ✓ Extends existing IPC patterns in the codebase
- ✓ Compatible with current preload script structure
- ✓ Works with existing window.electronAPI interface
- ✓ Does not break existing "open-settings" IPC

## Technical Requirements

### IPC Channel Structure

```typescript
// Channel names
const SETTINGS_CHANNELS = {
  LOAD: "settings:load",
  SAVE: "settings:save",
  RESET: "settings:reset",
} as const;

// Request/Response types
interface SettingsLoadResponse {
  success: boolean;
  data?: PersistedSettingsData;
  error?: { message: string; code: string };
}
```

### Main Process Handler Pattern

```typescript
ipcMain.handle(SETTINGS_CHANNELS.LOAD, async () => {
  try {
    // Implementation will use settings repository
    return { success: true, data: settings };
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error: serializeError(error) };
  }
});
```

### Preload API Extension

```typescript
electronAPI: {
  // Existing API...
  settings: {
    load: () => ipcRenderer.invoke(SETTINGS_CHANNELS.LOAD),
    save: (data) => ipcRenderer.invoke(SETTINGS_CHANNELS.SAVE, data),
    reset: () => ipcRenderer.invoke(SETTINGS_CHANNELS.RESET)
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

- None - this is the foundation feature

## Implementation Guidance

1. Start by creating the type definitions to establish contracts
2. Implement main process handlers with placeholder logic (actual repository integration comes later)
3. Extend preload script to expose the settings API
4. Test IPC communication with simple round-trip messages
5. Ensure error handling works across process boundary

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for main process handlers
- Unit tests for error serialization
- Integration test for IPC round-trip communication
- Verify context isolation is maintained
- Test error scenarios (handler throws, invalid data)

## Security Considerations

- Never expose direct file paths to renderer
- Validate all input in main process handlers
- Use invoke/handle pattern (not send/on) for better security
- Ensure no sensitive data in error messages

## Performance Requirements

- IPC operations should complete within 100ms
- Error responses should be immediate
- No blocking operations in handlers

## Important Notes

- This feature does NOT include actual file operations or repository integration
- Focus is purely on establishing communication channels
- Keep implementation minimal - enhance in later features as needed
- No performance or integration tests should be included in the implementation
