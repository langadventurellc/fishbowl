# Configure Desktop Adapter Provider for Application

## Overview

Set up the desktop settings adapter to be available throughout the application by creating a provider configuration. This enables UI components to use the useSettingsPersistence hook with the desktop-specific adapter.

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Adapter Provider Configuration**
   - Create file: `apps/desktop/src/adapters/settingsAdapterProvider.tsx`
   - This will configure the adapter for use with the persistence system

2. **Implementation Details**

   ```typescript
   import { createSettingsPersistenceAdapter } from "@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared";
   import { desktopSettingsAdapter } from "./desktopSettingsAdapter";

   // Create and export the configured adapter provider
   export const settingsPersistenceAdapter = createSettingsPersistenceAdapter({
     adapter: desktopSettingsAdapter,
   });
   ```

3. **Update Main Application Entry**
   - Modify: `apps/desktop/src/main.tsx` or `apps/desktop/src/App.tsx`
   - Import the adapter configuration
   - Make it available to the component tree

4. **Export for Component Usage**
   - Create barrel export in `apps/desktop/src/adapters/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export { desktopSettingsAdapter } from "./desktopSettingsAdapter";
   export { settingsPersistenceAdapter } from "./settingsAdapterProvider";
   ```

## Integration Pattern

The adapter should be configured at the application root level so that any component can use the useSettingsPersistence hook:

```typescript
// In components that need settings persistence:
import { useSettingsPersistence } from "@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared";
import { settingsPersistenceAdapter } from "../adapters";

function SettingsComponent() {
  const { save, load, reset, isLoading, error } = useSettingsPersistence({
    adapter: settingsPersistenceAdapter,
  });

  // Use the persistence operations...
}
```

## Unit Tests

Include unit tests in the same task:

- Test file: `apps/desktop/src/adapters/__tests__/settingsAdapterProvider.test.ts`
- Verify adapter configuration is created correctly
- Verify exports are available
- Test that the adapter can be used with createSettingsPersistenceAdapter

## File Structure

After this task, the adapters directory should have:

```
apps/desktop/src/adapters/
├── __tests__/
│   ├── desktopSettingsAdapter.test.ts
│   └── settingsAdapterProvider.test.ts
├── desktopSettingsAdapter.ts
├── settingsAdapterProvider.tsx
└── index.ts
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Adapter provider configuration is created
- ✓ Desktop adapter is properly configured for use
- ✓ Barrel exports are set up for easy imports
- ✓ Configuration follows ui-shared patterns
- ✓ Unit tests verify configuration
- ✓ Adapter is ready for use in UI components
- ✓ Code follows project conventions

## Dependencies

- Requires T-implement-desktop-settings to be completed
- Uses createSettingsPersistenceAdapter from @fishbowl-ai/ui-shared

## Important Notes

- This task sets up the configuration but does NOT integrate with UI
- UI integration is a separate feature (not part of this feature)
- The adapter must be singleton - same instance used throughout app
- **No performance tests should be included in this task**

### Log

**2025-08-02T08:02:32.651076Z** - Configured desktop settings adapter provider for application-wide access to settings persistence. Created settingsPersistenceAdapter export that provides singleton access to the desktop settings adapter for use with useSettingsPersistence hook. Implemented comprehensive unit tests and verified all quality standards pass.

- filesChanged: ["apps/desktop/src/adapters/settingsAdapterProvider.tsx", "apps/desktop/src/adapters/index.ts", "apps/desktop/src/adapters/__tests__/settingsAdapterProvider.test.ts"]
