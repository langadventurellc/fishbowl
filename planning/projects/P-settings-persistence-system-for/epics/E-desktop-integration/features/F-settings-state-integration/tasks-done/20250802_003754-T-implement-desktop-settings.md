# Implement Desktop Settings Persistence Adapter

## Overview

Create the desktop-specific implementation of the SettingsPersistenceAdapter interface that serves as the bridge between the renderer process and the main process for settings operations. This adapter will use the IPC API exposed through window.electronAPI.settings to perform save, load, and reset operations.

## Technical Requirements

### File Location

- Create adapter at: `apps/desktop/src/adapters/desktopSettingsAdapter.ts`
- Create the `adapters` directory if it doesn't exist

### Implementation Details

1. **Import Dependencies**
   - Import `SettingsPersistenceAdapter` from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
   - Import `PersistedSettingsData` from `@fishbowl-ai/shared`
   - Import `SettingsPersistenceError` from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`

2. **Implement Adapter Methods**

   ```typescript
   export const desktopSettingsAdapter: SettingsPersistenceAdapter = {
     async save(settings: PersistedSettingsData): Promise<void> {
       // Call window.electronAPI.settings.save(settings)
       // Handle response and throw SettingsPersistenceError on failure
     },

     async load(): Promise<PersistedSettingsData | null> {
       // Call window.electronAPI.settings.load()
       // Handle response and return data or null
       // Throw SettingsPersistenceError on failure
     },

     async reset(): Promise<void> {
       // Call window.electronAPI.settings.reset()
       // Handle response and throw SettingsPersistenceError on failure
     },
   };
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   - Transform IPC error responses to SettingsPersistenceError instances
   - Use appropriate operation type ("save", "load", or "reset") in error constructor
   - Include the original error message from IPC response

4. **Type Safety**
   - Ensure all methods properly type the IPC responses
   - Use the IPC types from `apps/desktop/src/shared/ipc/index.ts`

## Unit Tests

Include comprehensive unit tests in the same task:

- Create test file: `apps/desktop/src/adapters/__tests__/desktopSettingsAdapter.test.ts`
- Mock window.electronAPI.settings methods
- Test successful operations for all three methods
- Test error handling and transformation
- Test null response handling for load method
- Ensure 100% code coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Adapter implements all three methods of SettingsPersistenceAdapter interface
- ✓ Uses window.electronAPI.settings for all operations
- ✓ Properly transforms IPC responses to expected return types
- ✓ Throws SettingsPersistenceError with correct operation type on failures
- ✓ Includes comprehensive unit tests with mocked IPC calls
- ✓ All tests pass and achieve 100% coverage
- ✓ Code follows project conventions and passes linting

## Dependencies

- This task depends on the IPC foundation already being in place (F-ipc-communication-foundation)
- Uses types from @fishbowl-ai/shared and @fishbowl-ai/ui-shared packages

## Important Notes

- This is a renderer-side adapter - it runs in the browser context
- Do NOT include any Node.js specific imports or file system operations
- The adapter should be stateless and rely entirely on IPC for operations
- **No performance tests should be included in this task**

### Log

**2025-08-02T05:37:54.013242Z** - Implemented Desktop Settings Persistence Adapter with comprehensive error handling and 100% test coverage. The adapter successfully bridges the renderer process and main process for settings operations using the IPC API exposed through window.electronAPI.settings. All three methods (save, load, reset) are implemented with proper error transformation to SettingsPersistenceError instances. The implementation handles all edge cases including missing electronAPI, various error types, and null/undefined scenarios. All 27 unit tests pass with complete coverage of success paths, error scenarios, and interface compliance.
