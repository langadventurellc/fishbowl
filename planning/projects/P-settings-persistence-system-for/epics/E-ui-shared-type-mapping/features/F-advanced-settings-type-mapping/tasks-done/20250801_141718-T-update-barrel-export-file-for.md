# Update barrel export file for advanced settings mapping functions

## Purpose

Update the existing index.ts file to export the advanced settings mapping functions, following the established pattern in the ui-shared package while preserving existing general and appearance settings exports.

## Implementation Details

### File Location

Update: `packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/settings/index.ts`

### Required Exports to Add

```typescript
// Advanced Settings Mapping Functions
export { mapAdvancedSettingsUIToPersistence } from "./mapAdvancedSettingsUIToPersistence";
export { mapAdvancedSettingsPersistenceToUI } from "./mapAdvancedSettingsPersistenceToUI";
```

### Expected Final Structure

The updated index.ts should include all settings mapping functions:

```typescript
// General Settings Mapping Functions
export { mapGeneralSettingsUIToPersistence } from "./mapGeneralSettingsUIToPersistence";
export { mapGeneralSettingsPersistenceToUI } from "./mapGeneralSettingsPersistenceToUI";

// Appearance Settings Mapping Functions
export { mapAppearanceSettingsUIToPersistence } from "./mapAppearanceSettingsUIToPersistence";
export { mapAppearanceSettingsPersistenceToUI } from "./mapAppearanceSettingsPersistenceToUI";

// Advanced Settings Mapping Functions
export { mapAdvancedSettingsUIToPersistence } from "./mapAdvancedSettingsUIToPersistence";
export { mapAdvancedSettingsPersistenceToUI } from "./mapAdvancedSettingsPersistenceToUI";
```

## Technical Approach

1. **Read existing index.ts**: Identify current exports to preserve
2. **Add advanced settings exports**: Include both mapping functions with clear naming
3. **Maintain existing exports**: Preserve all existing general and appearance settings exports
4. **Follow established patterns**: Use the same export style and grouping as existing entries
5. **Logical grouping**: Group advanced settings exports together with descriptive comments

### Implementation Strategy

- Add the advanced settings exports while preserving all existing content
- Use named exports for better tree-shaking and IDE support
- Group exports logically by settings type with comments
- Maintain alphabetical ordering within groups if applicable

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Clean barrel export file enables simple imports: `import { mapAdvancedSettingsUIToPersistence } from '@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared/mapping/settings'`
- ✓ All advanced settings mapping functions are exported
- ✓ Existing general and appearance settings exports are preserved
- ✓ Follows established naming and export patterns
- ✓ No breaking changes to existing import paths
- ✓ Supports tree-shaking for optimal bundle size
- ✓ TypeScript resolves all exports correctly
- ✓ Logical grouping with descriptive comments matches existing style

## Integration Requirements

- Verify compatibility with existing imports in the codebase
- Ensure mapping functions are accessible from ui-shared package
- Follow monorepo export patterns established in other packages
- Maintain consistency with existing barrel export structure

## Dependencies

- mapAdvancedSettingsUIToPersistence (from T-implement-2)
- mapAdvancedSettingsPersistenceToUI (from T-implement-3)
- Existing general and appearance settings mapping functions

## Testing Requirements

No separate unit tests needed for barrel exports, but verify:

- All exports resolve correctly
- No circular import issues
- Tree-shaking works as expected
- TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Existing imports continue to work without changes

## Notes

This is a simple organizational task that enables clean imports for the new advanced settings mapping functions. The actual functionality is provided by the individual mapping functions created in the prerequisite tasks.

## Security Considerations

- No security implications for barrel exports
- Ensure no accidental exposure of internal utilities
- Maintain separation of concerns with clean public API

### Log

**2025-08-01T19:17:18.514090Z** - Updated barrel export file for advanced settings mapping functions. The index.ts file now exports both mapAdvancedSettingsUIToPersistence and mapAdvancedSettingsPersistenceToUI functions, maintaining consistency with existing general and appearance settings exports. All functions are properly exported and accessible via clean import paths from the ui-shared package. No additional changes were needed as the exports were already correctly configured during the previous task implementation.
