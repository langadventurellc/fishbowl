# Create mapping utilities directory structure and foundation

## Context

This task sets up the foundational directory structure for common mapping utilities in the ui-shared package. These utilities will support bidirectional type mapping between UI form types and persistence types across the application.

**Epic Context**: [E-ui-shared-type-mapping](/planning/projects/P-settings-persistence-system-for/epics/E-ui-shared-type-mapping/epic.md)
**Feature Context**: [F-common-mapping-utilities](/planning/projects/P-settings-persistence-system-for/epics/E-ui-shared-type-mapping/features/F-common-mapping-utilities/feature.md)

## Implementation Requirements

### Directory Structure to Create

```
packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/
├── utils/
│   ├── __tests__/
│   └── index.ts
├── index.ts
└── types.ts
```

### Base Types File (types.ts)

Create foundational types that will be used across all mapping utilities:

```typescript
/**
 * Result type for mapping operations that can fail
 */
export type MappingResult<T> =
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: MappingError };

/**
 * Standard error type for mapping operations
 */
export interface MappingError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  field?: string;
  value?: unknown;
}

/**
 * Time unit types for conversion utilities
 */
export type TimeUnit = "ms" | "s";

/**
 * Generic mapper function type
 */
export type Mapper<TInput, TOutput> = (input: TInput) => TOutput;

/**
 * Mapper with error handling
 */
export type SafeMapper<TInput, TOutput> = (
  input: TInput,
) => MappingResult<TOutput>;
```

### Main Index File (mapping/index.ts)

Create central export point for the mapping system:

```typescript
export * from "./types";
export * from "./utils";
```

### Utils Index File (utils/index.ts)

Create placeholder for utility exports (will be populated by subsequent tasks):

```typescript
// Generic mapping helpers - populated by upcoming tasks
// Value transformation functions - populated by upcoming tasks
// Nested object utilities - populated by upcoming tasks
// Error handling utilities - populated by upcoming tasks
```

## Technical Approach

1. **Create Directory Structure**: Set up the nested mapping directory with proper organization
2. **Implement Base Types**: Define core types used throughout the mapping system
3. **Set Up Export Structure**: Create index files for clean API surface
4. **Follow Project Conventions**:
   - Use TypeScript strict mode
   - Follow existing naming patterns from packages/ui-shared/src/utils/
   - Use JSDoc comments for all public APIs
   - Organize by functionality with barrel exports

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✓ Directory structure created under packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/
- ✓ Base types defined in types.ts with full TypeScript support
- ✓ Index files created for proper export organization
- ✓ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✓ Follows existing project patterns from utils directory

### Code Quality Requirements

- ✓ All types have comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- ✓ Consistent naming conventions with rest of codebase
- ✓ No use of 'any' types
- ✓ Proper generic type constraints where applicable

### Integration Requirements

- ✓ Compatible with existing ui-shared package structure
- ✓ Ready for subsequent utility implementations
- ✓ Exports available from packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- ✓ Create test setup file following existing patterns
- ✓ Verify type exports work correctly
- ✓ Test directory structure is accessible
- ✓ No runtime errors when importing base types

**Test File Location**: `packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/utils/__tests__/setup.test.ts`

## Dependencies

This task has no dependencies and sets up the foundation for all subsequent mapping utility tasks.

## Files to Create/Modify

- Create: `packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/types.ts`
- Create: `packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/index.ts`
- Create: `packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/utils/index.ts`
- Create: `packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/utils/__tests__/setup.test.ts`
