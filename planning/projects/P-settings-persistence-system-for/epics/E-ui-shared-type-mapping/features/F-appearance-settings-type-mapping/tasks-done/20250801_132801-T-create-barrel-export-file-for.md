# Create barrel export file for appearance settings mapping functions

## Purpose

Create an index.ts file to provide clean imports for the appearance settings mapping functions, following the established pattern in the ui-shared package.

## Implementation Details

### File Location

Create: `packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/settings/index.ts`

### Required Exports

```typescript
// Appearance Settings Mapping Functions
export { mapAppearanceSettingsUIToPersistence } from "./mapAppearanceSettingsUIToPersistence";
export { mapAppearanceSettingsPersistenceToUI } from "./mapAppearanceSettingsPersistenceToUI";

// Re-export from existing general settings (if not already present)
export { mapGeneralSettingsUIToPersistence } from "./mapGeneralSettingsUIToPersistence";
export { mapGeneralSettingsPersistenceToUI } from "./mapGeneralSettingsPersistenceToUI";
```

## Technical Approach

1. **Check existing index.ts**: Determine if the file already exists and contains general settings exports
2. **Add appearance settings exports**: Include both mapping functions with clear naming
3. **Maintain existing exports**: Preserve any existing general settings exports
4. **Follow established patterns**: Use the same export style as other mapping modules

### Implementation Strategy

- If `index.ts` exists: Add appearance settings exports while preserving existing content
- If `index.ts` doesn't exist: Create new file with both general and appearance settings exports
- Use named exports for better tree-shaking and IDE support
- Group exports logically by settings type

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Clean barrel export file enables simple imports: `import { mapAppearanceSettingsUIToPersistence } from '@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared/mapping/settings'`
- ✓ All appearance settings mapping functions are exported
- ✓ Existing general settings exports are preserved (if present)
- ✓ Follows established naming and export patterns
- ✓ No breaking changes to existing import paths
- ✓ Supports tree-shaking for optimal bundle size
- ✓ TypeScript resolves all exports correctly

## Integration Requirements

- Verify compatibility with existing imports in the codebase
- Update package exports if needed for proper external access
- Ensure mapping functions are accessible from ui-shared package
- Follow monorepo export patterns established in other packages

## Dependencies

- mapAppearanceSettingsUIToPersistence (from T-implement)
- mapAppearanceSettingsPersistenceToUI (from T-implement-1)
- Existing general settings mapping functions (if present)

## Testing Requirements

No separate unit tests needed for barrel exports, but verify:

- All exports resolve correctly
- No circular import issues
- Tree-shaking works as expected
- TypeScript compilation succeeds

## Notes

This is a simple organizational task that enables clean imports. The actual functionality is provided by the individual mapping functions created in the prerequisite tasks.

### Log

**2025-08-01T18:28:01.961099Z** - Verified barrel export file already exists and is correctly implemented. The index.ts file in packages/ui-shared/src/mapping/settings/ exports all required appearance settings mapping functions (mapAppearanceSettingsUIToPersistence, mapAppearanceSettingsPersistenceToUI) while preserving existing general settings exports. All quality checks pass, confirming proper TypeScript resolution and no linting issues. Implementation enables clean imports as specified.
