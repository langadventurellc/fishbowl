# Implement Configuration Cache Infrastructure

## Context

The LlmConfigService currently makes storage calls for every read operation, which is inefficient. According to the State Management System feature specification, we need to implement an in-memory cache using a Map structure for O(1) lookups and maintain cache synchronization with storage operations.

**File to modify**: `apps/desktop/src/electron/services/LlmConfigService.ts`

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Add Cache Properties

Add private cache properties to the LlmConfigService class:

```typescript
private cache: Map<string, LlmConfig> = new Map();
private initialized: boolean = false;
```

### 2. Implement Cache Initialization Logic

Modify the existing `initialize()` method to load all configurations into cache:

```typescript
async initialize(): Promise<void> {
  if (this.initialized) return;

  try {
    // Load all configurations from storage using existing list() method
    const configs = await this.getAllConfigurationsFromStorage();

    // Populate cache
    configs.forEach((config) => {
      this.cache.set(config.id, config);
    });

    this.initialized = true;
    this.logger.info(`Loaded ${configs.length} LLM configurations into cache`);
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error("Failed to initialize LLM config cache", error);
    // Continue with empty cache for graceful degradation
    this.initialized = true;
  }
}
```

### 3. Add ensureInitialized Helper

Create a private helper method to ensure cache is initialized before operations:

```typescript
private async ensureInitialized(): Promise<void> {
  if (!this.initialized) {
    await this.initialize();
  }
}
```

### 4. Create Storage-Only Methods

Refactor existing methods to separate storage operations from cache operations by creating private storage-only versions of CRUD methods that the cache initialization can use.

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Cache is implemented using Map<string, LlmConfig> structure
- ✓ Cache provides O(1) lookup time for configurations by ID
- ✓ initialize() method populates cache from storage on first call
- ✓ ensureInitialized() method ensures lazy initialization
- ✓ Cache initialization is idempotent (safe to call multiple times)
- ✓ Initialization failures are handled gracefully with empty cache
- ✓ All existing functionality continues to work unchanged
- ✓ Comprehensive unit tests cover cache initialization scenarios
- ✓ Unit tests verify graceful handling of storage failures during init

## Testing Requirements

Add unit tests for:

1. Cache initializes with existing configurations from storage
2. Cache initializes with empty storage (no configurations)
3. Cache handles storage errors during initialization gracefully
4. ensureInitialized() works correctly for both initialized and uninitialized states
5. initialize() is idempotent and doesn't reload cache on subsequent calls

## Technical Notes

- Follow the existing error handling patterns in the service
- Use the existing logger instance for cache-related logging
- Don't break existing functionality - this is purely additive infrastructure
- Keep cache operations separate from storage operations for now (next task will integrate them)

## Dependencies

This task has no dependencies and can be started immediately.

### Log

**2025-08-07T16:34:58.022932Z** - Implemented Configuration Cache Infrastructure for LlmConfigService with O(1) lookups and graceful error handling. Cache is populated on initialization using a Map<string, LlmConfig> structure. Added idempotent initialization with fallback to empty cache on storage failures. All existing functionality remains unchanged - this is purely additive infrastructure for the next task to utilize.
