# UI Interactions and Form Handling

## Purpose

Implement the complete user interaction flow for managing LLM configurations, including form handling, validation feedback, loading states, error displays, and optimistic UI updates. This feature brings together all the components, hooks, and IPC client to create a seamless user experience.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Form Interaction Logic

- Form field change handlers
- Real-time validation feedback
- Submit and cancel actions
- Form reset after successful submission
- Dirty state tracking to warn about unsaved changes

### 2. Loading and Progress States

- Loading indicators during async operations
- Disabled states during processing
- Progress feedback for long operations
- Skeleton loaders for initial data fetch

### 3. Error Display and Recovery

- Error toast notifications
- Inline field validation errors
- Error recovery actions (retry, cancel)
- Clear error messaging for users

### 4. Optimistic UI Updates

- Immediate UI updates on user actions
- Rollback on operation failure
- Smooth transitions between states
- Conflict resolution for concurrent updates

### 5. User Feedback Systems

- Success notifications for completed actions
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Tooltips for additional information
- Help text for form fields

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Form Interactions

- ✓ All form fields properly controlled
- ✓ Validation triggers on blur and submit
- ✓ Error messages display below fields
- ✓ Submit button disabled when form invalid
- ✓ Cancel button resets form and closes modal

### User Experience

- ✓ Loading spinner during data fetch
- ✓ Buttons disabled during operations
- ✓ Success toast after operations complete
- ✓ Error messages are actionable
- ✓ Smooth animations for state transitions

### Validation Feedback

- ✓ Required fields marked with asterisk
- ✓ Field turns red on validation error
- ✓ Error message explains the issue
- ✓ Success checkmark for valid fields
- ✓ Character counter for limited fields

### Delete Confirmation

- ✓ Confirmation dialog before deletion
- ✓ Clear warning about consequences
- ✓ Require explicit confirmation
- ✓ Show which configuration being deleted

### Optimistic Updates

- ✓ List updates immediately on add/edit
- ✓ Card shows loading state during save
- ✓ Rollback to previous state on error
- ✓ Merge server response when complete

## Technical Requirements

### Integration Components

```
apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/
├── LlmSetupSection.tsx (enhanced with interactions)
├── LlmConfigModal.tsx (enhanced with form handling)
├── LlmProviderCard.tsx (enhanced with actions)
└── ConfirmDeleteDialog.tsx (new component)

apps/desktop/src/lib/llm/
├── formValidation.ts
├── optimisticUpdates.ts
└── errorMessages.ts
```

### Validation Rules

- **Custom Name**: Required, 1-100 characters, unique
- **Provider**: Required, must be valid selection
- **API Key**: Required, format varies by provider
- **Base URL**: Required for custom provider, valid URL format
- **Auth Header**: Optional boolean flag

### Error Message Mapping

```typescript
const errorMessages = {
  DUPLICATE_NAME: "A configuration with this name already exists",
  INVALID_API_KEY: "Invalid API key format for selected provider",
  NETWORK_ERROR: "Unable to save configuration. Please try again.",
  VALIDATION_ERROR: "Please fix the errors below",
  // ... more messages
};
```

### Loading State Management

- Show spinner overlay during save
- Disable form inputs during submission
- Show skeleton cards during initial load
- Progress bar for batch operations

## Implementation Guidance

### Form Best Practices

- Use controlled components for all inputs
- Debounce validation for text inputs
- Show validation only after user interaction
- Clear errors when user fixes them

### Optimistic Update Pattern

```typescript
// 1. Update UI immediately
setConfigurations(optimisticUpdate(configurations, newConfig));

// 2. Send request to backend
try {
  const result = await ipcClient.createConfig(newConfig);
  // 3. Merge server response
  setConfigurations(mergeServerResponse(configurations, result));
} catch (error) {
  // 4. Rollback on failure
  setConfigurations(rollback(configurations));
  showError(error);
}
```

### User Notification System

- Use toast notifications for success/error
- Position toasts consistently (top-right)
- Auto-dismiss success after 3 seconds
- Keep errors until user dismisses
- Stack multiple notifications

### Accessibility Requirements

- Announce loading states to screen readers
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for actions
- Ensure focus management in modals
- Label all form fields properly

## Testing Requirements

- Test all user interaction flows
- Verify validation triggers correctly
- Test optimistic update scenarios
- Verify error recovery mechanisms
- Test keyboard navigation

## Security Considerations

- Mask API key input field
- Clear sensitive data from forms after submit
- Don't store form data in localStorage
- Sanitize user inputs before display

## Performance Requirements

- Debounce form validation (300ms)
- Throttle rapid submissions
- Cancel pending requests on unmount
- Minimize re-renders during typing

## Edge Cases to Handle

- Rapid add/delete operations
- Network disconnection during save
- Invalid data from backend
- Concurrent edits to same config
- Browser refresh during operation

## Dependencies

- Requires all three previous features to be complete:
  - F-react-components-and-ui-layout (UI components)
  - F-react-hooks-and-frontend-state (state management)
  - F-ipc-client-integration (backend communication)
