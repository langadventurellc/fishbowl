# Storage and Repository Layer

## Purpose and Goals

Implement the foundational data persistence layer for LLM configurations, providing secure storage for API keys and file-based storage for configuration metadata. This epic establishes the repository pattern that abstracts storage details from the business logic layer.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### 1. Secure Storage Service

- Implementation of `LlmSecureStorage.ts` using Electron's safeStorage API
- Encryption/decryption methods for API keys
- Key management with unique IDs
- Error handling for storage failures

### 2. File Storage Integration

- Integration with existing `FileStorageService`
- JSON structure for `llm_config.json`
- Metadata persistence (custom names, base URLs, provider types)
- File location following `preferences.json` pattern

### 3. Repository Implementation

- `LlmConfigRepository.ts` with clean abstraction over both storage mechanisms
- Unified interface for CRUD operations
- ID-based linking between secure storage and file metadata
- Transaction-like operations for consistency

### 4. Storage IPC Handlers

- Basic IPC handlers for storage operations in `llmConfigHandlers.ts`
- Secure data transfer between processes
- Error serialization for cross-process communication

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Secure Storage

- ✓ API keys are encrypted using Electron's safeStorage API
- ✓ Each API key has a unique ID for reference
- ✓ Secure storage is initialized before first use
- ✓ Storage failures are handled gracefully
- ✓ API keys are never exposed in plain text

### File Storage

- ✓ Configuration metadata stored in `{userData}/llm_config.json`
- ✓ File has proper permissions (0600)
- ✓ JSON structure is well-defined and versioned
- ✓ File corruption is detected and handled
- ✓ Follows existing FileStorageService patterns

### Repository Pattern

- ✓ Clean interface abstracting storage implementation
- ✓ All CRUD operations work through repository
- ✓ Consistent error handling across storage types
- ✓ Atomic operations where possible
- ✓ Proper cleanup on delete operations

### Data Integrity

- ✓ Metadata and secure storage stay synchronized
- ✓ Orphaned entries are prevented
- ✓ Recovery mechanism for inconsistent state
- ✓ Validation before storage operations

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Pattern

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Repository Layer"
        Repo[LlmConfigRepository]
    end

    subgraph "Storage Services"
        Secure[LlmSecureStorage<br/>Electron safeStorage]
        File[FileStorageService<br/>JSON Persistence]
    end

    subgraph "Data"
        Keys[Encrypted API Keys]
        Meta[Configuration Metadata]
    end

    Repo --> Secure
    Repo --> File
    Secure --> Keys
    File --> Meta

    Keys -.ID Reference.-> Meta
```

### Key Design Decisions

- Use UUID for configuration IDs to ensure uniqueness
- Separate concerns: secure data vs metadata
- Repository pattern for future storage flexibility
- Follow existing codebase patterns (no over-engineering)

### File Structure

```
apps/desktop/src/
├── electron/
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── LlmSecureStorage.ts
│   └── llmConfigHandlers.ts (storage-specific handlers)
└── repositories/
    └── LlmConfigRepository.ts

Configuration File:
{userData}/llm_config.json
```

## Dependencies

No dependencies on other epics - this is the foundational layer.

## Estimated Scale

- 3-4 features covering storage implementation, repository pattern, and IPC integration
- Foundation for all other LLM configuration functionality

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I need a secure way to store API keys so that user credentials are protected
2. **As a developer**, I need a repository pattern so that storage implementation can evolve without affecting business logic
3. **As a system**, I need consistent storage operations so that data integrity is maintained

## Non-functional Requirements

### Performance

- Storage operations complete within 100ms
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Minimal impact on app startup time

### Security

- API keys encrypted at rest
- No plain text exposure in logs or errors
- Secure IPC communication
- File permissions properly set

### Reliability

- Graceful degradation on storage failures
- Data consistency between storage types
- Recovery from corrupted state
- Comprehensive error logging

# Completed Work Summary

## Overview

All three major features of the Storage and Repository Layer epic have been successfully completed with **11 tasks** delivered across three feature areas. The implementation provides a robust, secure foundation for LLM configuration management with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and full test coverage.

## Feature 1: Storage Services Implementation

**Status: ✅ Complete** | **4 Tasks Delivered**

### Key Deliverables

- **Comprehensive Type System**: Created modular type definitions in `packages/shared/src/types/llmConfig/` with separate files for each type following the one-export-per-file rule
- **Secure API Key Storage**: Implemented `LlmSecureStorage` class using Electron's safeStorage API with encryption/decryption capabilities and graceful handling of storage unavailability
- **File-based Metadata Storage**: Developed `LlmFileStorage` service with atomic file operations, proper permissions (0600), and cross-platform storage using userData directory
- **Unified Architecture**: Refactored to use shared package architecture, eliminated duplication by leveraging existing `FileStorageService`, and implemented clean repository pattern

### Technical Achievements

- **Security**: All API keys encrypted at rest with Electron's safeStorage, no sensitive data in logs
- **Reliability**: Atomic write operations with temporary files to prevent corruption
- **Platform Support**: Cross-platform storage locations following Electron best practices
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with `StorageResult<T>` pattern
- **Performance**: Optimized operations with proper caching and efficient file I/O

### Architecture Refactoring

- Moved from desktop-specific implementation to **shared package architecture**
- Eliminated custom `LlmFileStorage` in favor of existing `FileStorageService`
- Implemented proper separation of concerns: shared package for business logic, desktop app for platform-specific code
