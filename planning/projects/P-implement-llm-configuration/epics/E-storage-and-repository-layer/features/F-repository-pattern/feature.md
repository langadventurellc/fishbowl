# Repository Pattern Implementation

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement the repository pattern that provides a clean abstraction over both secure storage and file storage mechanisms. This feature creates a unified interface for all LLM configuration CRUD operations, maintaining data consistency between the two storage systems.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. LLM Configuration Repository (`LlmConfigRepository.ts`)

- Repository class with unified CRUD interface
- Coordination between secure storage and file storage
- ID-based linking between API keys and metadata
- Transaction-like operations for atomic updates
- Data consistency management

### 2. Repository Operations

- Create: Add new configuration with both API key and metadata
- Read: Retrieve single configuration by ID
- Update: Modify existing configuration atomically
- Delete: Remove configuration from both storages
- List: Get all configurations with metadata
- Exists: Check if configuration exists

### 3. Data Models

- Complete LLM configuration type (combines secure and metadata)
- Repository request/response types
- Error handling types
- Validation schemas using Zod

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Repository Operations

- ✓ Create operation stores API key securely and metadata in file
- ✓ Read operation retrieves complete configuration by ID
- ✓ Update operation modifies both storages atomically
- ✓ Delete operation removes from both storages
- ✓ List operation returns all configurations (without API keys)
- ✓ Operations maintain consistency between storages

### Data Consistency

- ✓ Both storages updated together or not at all
- ✓ Orphaned entries are prevented
- ✓ Missing API keys handled gracefully (returns null)
- ✓ Corrupted metadata handled with recovery
- ✓ ID references stay synchronized

### Error Handling

- ✓ Storage failures don't leave inconsistent state
- ✓ Clear error messages for different failure types
- ✓ Graceful degradation when secure storage unavailable
- ✓ Recovery mechanism for partial failures

## Technical Requirements

### Repository Interface

```typescript
interface LlmConfigRepository {
  create(config: LlmConfigInput): Promise<LlmConfig>;
  read(id: string): Promise<LlmConfig | null>;
  update(id: string, updates: Partial<LlmConfigInput>): Promise<LlmConfig>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
  list(): Promise<LlmConfigMetadata[]>;
  exists(id: string): Promise<boolean>;
}

interface LlmConfig {
  id: string;
  customName: string;
  provider: string;
  apiKey: string; // Decrypted when read
  baseUrl?: string;
  authHeaderType?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### File Structure

```
apps/desktop/src/
└── repositories/
    └── LlmConfigRepository.ts

packages/shared/src/
└── types/
    └── llmConfig.ts  // Shared types and Zod schemas
```

### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
class LlmConfigRepository {
  constructor(
    private secureStorage: LlmSecureStorage,
    private fileStorage: FileStorageService,
  ) {}

  // Atomic operations coordinating both storages
}
```

## Dependencies on Other Features

- **F-storage-services-implementation**: Requires LlmSecureStorage and file storage integration

## Implementation Guidance

1. **Define shared types first** - Create types in shared package for cross-platform use
2. **Implement repository class** - Focus on coordinating storage services
3. **Ensure atomicity** - Both storages succeed or both rollback
4. **Handle edge cases** - Missing keys, corrupted files, etc.
5. **Use existing patterns** - Look at other repositories in the codebase
6. **Simple validation** - Basic Zod schemas, no complex rules yet

## Testing Requirements

- Test all CRUD operations work correctly
- Verify atomicity of multi-storage operations
- Test recovery from storage failures
- Confirm orphaned entries are prevented
- Validate data consistency after operations

## Security Considerations

- Never expose API keys in list operations
- Validate all input data before storage
- Handle secure storage unavailability
- Ensure IDs are properly sanitized
- No sensitive data in error messages

## Performance Requirements

- Repository operations complete within 50ms
- Batch operations where possible
- Cache metadata for list operations
- Minimize file I/O operations
- Async operations to prevent blocking
