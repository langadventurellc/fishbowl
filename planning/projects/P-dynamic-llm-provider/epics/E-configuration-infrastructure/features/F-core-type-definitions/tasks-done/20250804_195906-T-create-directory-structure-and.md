## Task Description

Create the foundational directory structure for LLM provider types in the shared package and set up barrel exports for clean module organization.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Directory Structure**:

   ```
   packages/shared/src/types/llm-providers/
   ├── index.ts                    # Barrel exports
   ├── provider.types.ts           # Core provider interfaces
   ├── field.types.ts              # Field configuration types
   ├── configuration.types.ts      # Runtime configuration types
   ├── storage.types.ts            # Storage bridge interfaces
   └── validation.types.ts         # Validation error types
   ```

2. **Create Barrel Export (index.ts)**:
   - Export all types from each module file
   - Use `export * from './module-name'` pattern
   - Follow existing patterns from `packages/shared/src/types/settings/index.ts`

3. **Add to Parent Barrel Export**:
   - Update `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts` to include exports from llm-providers
   - Add line: `export * from './llm-providers';`

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Directory structure created under `packages/shared/src/types/llm-providers/`
- ✓ All 6 TypeScript files created with proper naming convention
- ✓ Barrel export file includes exports for all modules
- ✓ Parent types index includes llm-providers exports
- ✓ No linting or TypeScript errors
- ✓ Follows existing patterns from settings types structure

## Testing

- Run `pnpm quality` to ensure no linting/formatting issues
- Run `pnpm build:libs` to ensure types compile correctly
- Verify imports work from consuming packages

## Technical Context

Review the existing structure at `packages/shared/src/types/settings/` for patterns to follow. The barrel export pattern helps maintain clean imports and follows the monorepo's established conventions.

### Log

**2025-08-05T00:59:06.072642Z** - Successfully created the foundational directory structure for LLM provider types in the shared package. Implemented complete barrel export system following established patterns from settings types. All files created with proper JSDoc documentation headers and TypeScript strict mode compliance. Quality checks and build verification passed successfully.
