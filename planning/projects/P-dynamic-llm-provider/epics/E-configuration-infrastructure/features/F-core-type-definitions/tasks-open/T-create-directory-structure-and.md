## Task Description

Create the foundational directory structure for LLM provider types in the shared package and set up barrel exports for clean module organization.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Directory Structure**:

   ```
   packages/shared/src/types/llm-providers/
   ├── index.ts                    # Barrel exports
   ├── provider.types.ts           # Core provider interfaces
   ├── field.types.ts              # Field configuration types
   ├── configuration.types.ts      # Runtime configuration types
   ├── storage.types.ts            # Storage bridge interfaces
   └── validation.types.ts         # Validation error types
   ```

2. **Create Barrel Export (index.ts)**:
   - Export all types from each module file
   - Use `export * from './module-name'` pattern
   - Follow existing patterns from `packages/shared/src/types/settings/index.ts`

3. **Add to Parent Barrel Export**:
   - Update `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts` to include exports from llm-providers
   - Add line: `export * from './llm-providers';`

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Directory structure created under `packages/shared/src/types/llm-providers/`
- ✓ All 6 TypeScript files created with proper naming convention
- ✓ Barrel export file includes exports for all modules
- ✓ Parent types index includes llm-providers exports
- ✓ No linting or TypeScript errors
- ✓ Follows existing patterns from settings types structure

## Testing

- Run `pnpm quality` to ensure no linting/formatting issues
- Run `pnpm build:libs` to ensure types compile correctly
- Verify imports work from consuming packages

## Technical Context

Review the existing structure at `packages/shared/src/types/settings/` for patterns to follow. The barrel export pattern helps maintain clean imports and follows the monorepo's established conventions.
