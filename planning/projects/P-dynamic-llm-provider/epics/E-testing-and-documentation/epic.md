## Purpose and Goals

Ensure comprehensive testing coverage and documentation for the dynamic LLM provider system. This epic establishes quality assurance practices, automated testing, and clear documentation for users and developers.

## Major Components and Deliverables

1. **Unit Testing Suite**
   - Configuration loader tests
   - Storage service tests
   - Form generation tests
   - Store operation tests
   - Validation logic tests

2. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end configuration flow
   - Storage persistence verification
   - Multi-window synchronization
   - Settings integration tests
   - IPC communication tests

3. **Security Testing**
   - API key protection verification
   - Secure storage validation
   - Memory leak prevention
   - Permission handling tests

4. **Documentation**
   - User guide for LLM setup
   - Developer guide for adding providers
   - JSON schema documentation
   - API reference documentation
   - Migration guide from hardcoded system

## Technical Considerations

- Use Jest for unit testing
- Use Playwright for E2E tests
- Mock keytar in test environments
- Document in Markdown format
- Include code examples

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want confidence that my changes don't break existing functionality
2. **As a user**, I want clear instructions for setting up providers
3. **As a developer**, I want to understand how to add new providers
4. **As a QA engineer**, I want comprehensive test coverage
5. **As a security auditor**, I want proof of secure key handling
