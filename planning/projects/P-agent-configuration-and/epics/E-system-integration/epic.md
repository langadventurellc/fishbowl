- Then:
  - Agent model provider (openai, anthropic, google) maps to AIService provider configuration
  - Agent temperature, topP, and penalty parameters passed to AI service API calls
  - Model ID validation against available models for each provider
  - Configuration parameter validation occurs at integration boundary

**AC-1.2: Provider Capability Validation**

- Given: Agent model configurations with provider-specific parameters
- When: Agent configurations are validated against AI service capabilities
- Then:
  - Provider availability checked during agent configuration creation
  - Model ID existence validated against provider model lists
  - Parameter ranges validated against provider-specific constraints
  - Streaming support and other capabilities verified for agent configurations

**AC-1.3: Runtime AI Service Integration**

  - Configuration errors handled gracefully without breaking conversations

### AC-2: Database Integration

**AC-2.1: Database Schema Integration**

- Given: Existing conversation database schema

- Then:
  - Conversation table includes agent_configuration_id foreign key
  - Agent configuration IDs stored as references, not embedded data
  - Database constraints ensure referential integrity
  - Migration scripts handle existing conversation data gracefully

**AC-2.2: Configuration Reference Management**

- Given: Database relationships between conversations and agent configurations
- When: Agent configurations are modified or deleted
- Then:
  - Configuration updates do not affect existing conversation history

  - Configuration versioning considered for conversation history integrity
  - Database queries efficiently resolve agent configuration details

**AC-2.3: Data Consistency and Migration**

- Given: Existing conversation data and new agent configuration system
- When: Database migrations are applied
- Then:

  - Data migration preserves conversation history and context
  - Rollback procedures restore system to previous state if needed

### AC-3: Platform Bridge Integration

**AC-3.1: File System Bridge Implementation**

- Given: Cross-platform deployment requirements (desktop/mobile)
- When: Configuration file operations are performed
- Then:
  - File operations abstracted through platform-specific bridge implementations
  - Desktop bridge uses Electron secure storage for sensitive data
  - Mobile bridge uses Expo SecureStore for sensitive configuration
  - Configuration file paths resolved correctly on all platforms

**AC-3.2: Storage Security Integration**

- Given: Configuration data including potentially sensitive information

  - Non-sensitive configuration data stored in accessible JSON files
  - Storage security policies enforced consistently across platforms
  - Configuration access controlled by platform permission systems

**AC-3.3: Cross-Platform Synchronization**

  - Service initialization occurs during application startup
  - Service cleanup handled during application shutdown

**AC-4.2: Error Handling Integration**

- Given: Application-wide error handling and user feedback systems
- When: Configuration errors occur
- Then:
  - Configuration validation errors integrated with application error reporting
  - User-friendly error messages displayed in platform-specific UI components
  - Error logging follows application logging standards and formats
  - Error recovery mechanisms integrated with application retry policies

**AC-4.3: Performance and Monitoring Integration**

- Given: Application performance monitoring and metrics collection
- When: Configuration operations are performed
- Then:
  - Configuration service performance metrics collected and reported
  - Operation latency and success rates monitored
  - Resource usage (memory, disk) tracked for configuration operations
  - Performance alerts configured for configuration service degradation

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Architecture Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern**: Existing services adapted to use new configuration system
- **Bridge Pattern**: Platform-specific implementations hidden behind common interfaces
- **Observer Pattern**: Configuration changes notify dependent systems
- **Factory Pattern**: Agent configurations used to create properly configured AI service instances

### Backward Compatibility Strategy

- **Graceful Migration**: Existing system continues operation during configuration system integration
- **Default Configurations**: Reasonable defaults provided for systems not yet using agent configurations
- **Phased Integration**: Integration proceeds incrementally without breaking existing functionality
- **Rollback Capability**: Integration changes can be reverted if issues arise

### Error Handling and Resilience

- **Circuit Breaker**: Configuration service failures don't cascade to dependent systems
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Default configurations used when configuration service unavailable
- **Retry Logic**: Transient configuration service failures handled with appropriate retries
- **Degraded Mode**: Application continues with reduced functionality when configuration system unavailable
