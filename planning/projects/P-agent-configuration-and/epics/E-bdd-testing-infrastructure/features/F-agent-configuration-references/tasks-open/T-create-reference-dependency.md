# Reference Dependency Tracking Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for agent configuration reference dependency tracking, focusing on complex dependency scenarios, circular reference detection, and dependency resolution across service boundaries. This builds on the cross-service reference validation foundation.

## Technical Approach

Follow established BDD integration test patterns while focusing on dependency graph construction and validation. Implement comprehensive circular reference detection and dependency resolution order optimization.

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Test File Creation**: Create `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/agent-references-dependency-tracking.integration.spec.ts`

2. **Test Structure**: Follow established BDD patterns covering AC-2 requirements:
   - Feature: Agent Configuration References Integration
   - Scenario: Reference dependency tracking across services
   - Complex dependency graph validation
   - Circular reference detection and prevention

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Multi-layered dependency tracking across PersonalityService, RoleService, ModelService
   - Circular reference detection with clear error reporting and dependency chain information
   - Dependency resolution order optimization for performance (within 500ms requirement)
   - Reference change propagation through dependent configurations
   - Complex interdependent reference scenarios

4. **Dependency Graph Testing**:
   - Build and validate reference dependency graphs across service boundaries
   - Test complex dependency chains (A→B→C→D scenarios)
   - Validate dependency resolution ordering for performance optimization
   - Test dependency change impact analysis and propagation

5. **Circular Reference Detection**:
   - Direct circular references (A→B→A)
   - Indirect circular references (A→B→C→A)
   - Multi-service circular references spanning service boundaries
   - Detailed dependency chain reporting in error messages

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Dependency Tracking Coverage

- ✅ Reference dependency graphs built correctly across PersonalityService, RoleService, ModelService
- ✅ Complex interdependent reference scenarios tracked through multiple service layers
- ✅ Dependency resolution order optimized for performance (500ms requirement)
- ✅ Reference change propagation validated through dependent configurations

### Circular Reference Detection

- ✅ Direct circular references detected and prevented with clear error reporting
- ✅ Indirect circular references detected across multiple dependency levels
- ✅ Cross-service circular references identified spanning service boundaries
- ✅ Detailed dependency chain information provided in error messages

### Performance Requirements

- ✅ Complex dependency graphs resolved within 500ms performance requirement
- ✅ Dependency tracking optimized for large-scale reference networks
- ✅ Circular reference detection algorithms efficient for complex scenarios

## Security Considerations

- Dependency tracking respects security boundaries and authorization controls
- Reference access validation maintained throughout dependency resolution
- Circular reference detection prevents potential security exploitation scenarios
- Cross-service dependency validation maintains security context integrity

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: T-create-cross-service-reference (reference validation foundation)
- **External**: PersonalityService, RoleService, ModelService interface definitions
- **Test Infrastructure**: Jest BDD framework, dependency graph test utilities

## File Structure

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/
├── agent-references-dependency-tracking.integration.spec.ts (NEW)
```

## Testing Requirements

Include comprehensive unit tests for dependency tracking logic within the same task:

- Dependency graph construction algorithms
- Circular reference detection logic
- Dependency resolution ordering algorithms
- Performance optimization edge cases
- Error handling and reporting mechanisms

## Implementation Notes

- Build on patterns established in cross-service reference validation task
- Focus on complex dependency scenarios that span multiple services
- Implement efficient circular reference detection algorithms
- Ensure comprehensive error reporting with dependency chain context
- Validate performance requirements for complex dependency resolution scenarios
