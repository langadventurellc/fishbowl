# Reference Resolution Workflow Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for reference resolution workflows, focusing on end-to-end reference resolution scenarios, caching optimization, and batch processing workflows. This task covers the complete reference resolution pipeline across multiple service layers.

## Technical Approach

Follow established BDD patterns while focusing on complete resolution workflows, performance optimization through caching, and batch operation scenarios. Test the system's ability to efficiently resolve complex reference networks.

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Test File Creation**: Create `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/agent-references-resolution.integration.spec.ts`

2. **Test Structure**: Follow established BDD patterns covering comprehensive resolution workflows:
   - Feature: Agent Configuration References Integration
   - Scenario: Complete reference resolution workflows
   - End-to-end resolution testing across service boundaries
   - Performance optimization and caching scenarios

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Complete reference resolution workflows from agent creation to component binding
   - Reference caching optimization for frequently accessed components
   - Batch reference resolution for multiple agent configurations
   - Resolution workflow performance validation (within 300ms requirement)
   - Error recovery and fallback mechanisms during resolution failures

4. **Resolution Workflow Testing**:
   - Agent creation with complex reference resolution requirements
   - Multi-step resolution workflows involving personality, role, and model services
   - Resolution result caching and cache invalidation scenarios
   - Concurrent resolution scenarios with proper coordination

5. **Performance and Caching**:
   - Reference resolution caching for improved performance
   - Cache hit/miss scenarios and performance impact validation
   - Batch operation optimization for multiple reference resolutions
   - Cache invalidation on component updates or deletions

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Resolution Workflow Coverage

- ✅ Complete end-to-end reference resolution workflows from creation to binding
- ✅ Multi-service resolution coordination with proper error handling
- ✅ Resolution workflow performance meeting 300ms requirement
- ✅ Concurrent resolution scenarios handled with proper coordination

### Caching and Performance

- ✅ Reference resolution caching implemented for frequently accessed components
- ✅ Cache efficiency validated with hit/miss ratio optimization
- ✅ Batch reference resolution optimized for multiple agent configurations
- ✅ Cache invalidation properly handled on component updates

### Error Recovery

- ✅ Resolution workflow error recovery with appropriate fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Partial resolution failure handling with rollback capabilities
- ✅ Service unavailability scenarios handled gracefully with retry logic
- ✅ Resolution timeout scenarios with proper cleanup and error reporting

## Security Considerations

- Reference resolution respects authorization controls throughout the workflow
- Cached reference data maintains security context and access controls
- Batch operations validate permissions for all referenced components
- Resolution workflows preserve audit trails for security compliance

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: T-create-referential-integrity (integrity enforcement foundation)
- **External**: PersonalityService, RoleService, ModelService resolution operations
- **Test Infrastructure**: Jest BDD framework, resolution workflow test utilities

## File Structure

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/
├── agent-references-resolution.integration.spec.ts (NEW)
```

## Testing Requirements

Include comprehensive unit tests for resolution workflow logic within the same task:

- Reference resolution algorithm implementations
- Caching logic and cache invalidation mechanisms
- Batch processing optimization algorithms
- Error recovery and fallback logic
- Performance optimization edge cases

## Implementation Notes

- Build on integrity enforcement patterns from previous task
- Focus on complete end-to-end resolution workflows
- Implement comprehensive caching and performance optimization testing
- Ensure proper error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- Test batch operation scenarios for performance validation
- Validate security aspects throughout resolution workflows
