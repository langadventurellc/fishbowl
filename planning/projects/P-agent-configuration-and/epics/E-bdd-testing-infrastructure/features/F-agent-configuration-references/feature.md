# Agent Configuration References Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for agent configuration reference management, focusing on cross-service reference validation, dependency tracking, and referential integrity. These tests verify agent configurations properly reference and integrate with personality, role, and model components across service boundaries.

## Key Components to Implement

- **Cross-Service Reference Validation**: Test reference integrity across PersonalityService, RoleService, and ModelService
- **Dependency Management**: Verify agent configuration dependency tracking and validation
- **Reference Resolution**: Test reference resolution workflows across multiple service layers
- **Referential Integrity Enforcement**: Ensure referenced components exist and are accessible

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Cross-Service Reference Integration

- **Given**: Agent configurations with references to personality, role, and model components
- **When**: References are validated and resolved through cross-service integration
- **Then**: All references are properly validated with comprehensive error handling
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Personality references are validated through PersonalityService integration
  - Role references are resolved correctly through RoleService coordination
  - Model references are verified against ModelService availability
  - Invalid references trigger specific error messages with service context

### AC-2: Reference Dependency Tracking

- **Given**: Complex agent configurations with multiple interdependent references
- **When**: Dependency tracking is performed across service boundaries
- **Then**: All dependencies are properly tracked with circular reference detection
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Reference dependency graphs are built correctly across services
  - Circular references are detected and prevented with clear error reporting
  - Dependency resolution order is optimized for performance
  - Reference changes propagate correctly through dependent configurations

### AC-3: Referential Integrity Enforcement

- **Given**: Agent configurations referencing external components that may change or be deleted
- **When**: Referential integrity is enforced through cross-service validation
- **Then**: Integrity constraints are maintained with appropriate conflict resolution
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Referenced component deletion is prevented when dependencies exist
  - Component updates maintain compatibility with referencing configurations
  - Orphaned references are detected and handled appropriately
  - Integrity violations provide guidance for resolution

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Agent Configuration References Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Validating cross-service references", () => {
    it.skip("should validate personality and role references through service integration", async () => {
      // Given - Agent configuration with personality and role references
      // When - Validating references through cross-service coordination
      // Then - All references are validated with proper error handling
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Reference Resolution Testing**: Test reference validation across multiple service boundaries
- **Dependency Graph Validation**: Focus on complex dependency scenarios and circular reference detection
- **Cross-Service Communication**: Test service communication patterns for reference validation
- **Integrity Constraint Testing**: Verify referential integrity enforcement mechanisms

### Testing Requirements

#### Reference Integration Coverage

- ✅ Cross-service reference validation with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Reference dependency tracking across PersonalityService, RoleService, and ModelService
- ✅ Circular reference detection and prevention with clear error reporting
- ✅ Reference resolution performance optimization and caching
- ✅ Referential integrity enforcement with conflict resolution
- ✅ Orphaned reference detection and cleanup workflows

#### Error Handling Integration

- ✅ Invalid reference errors provide service context and resolution guidance
- ✅ Reference resolution failures are handled gracefully across services
- ✅ Circular reference detection provides detailed dependency chain information
- ✅ Integrity violation errors maintain context from originating services

## Security Considerations

- **Reference Authorization**: Reference access respects security policies and authorization controls
- **Cross-Service Security**: Reference validation maintains security context across services
- **Data Access Control**: Referenced component access is validated against user permissions
- **Reference Integrity**: Reference validation prevents unauthorized access to restricted components

## Performance Requirements

- **Reference Validation Speed**: Cross-service reference validation completes within 300ms
- **Dependency Resolution**: Complex dependency graphs are resolved within 500ms
- **Cache Efficiency**: Frequently referenced components are cached for improved performance
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple reference validations are optimized for batch processing

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-agent-configuration-creation (agent creation foundation), F-personality-template-integration (personality references), F-role-management-custom-roles (role references)
- **External**: AgentService, PersonalityService, RoleService, ModelService, ReferenceService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Reference builders, dependency fixtures, cross-service mock coordination
