# Referential Integrity Enforcement Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for referential integrity enforcement across agent configuration references, focusing on preventing orphaned references, managing component lifecycle dependencies, and ensuring integrity constraints are maintained with appropriate conflict resolution.

## Technical Approach

Follow established BDD patterns while focusing on integrity constraint scenarios, component lifecycle management, and conflict resolution workflows. Test the system's ability to maintain referential integrity under various stress conditions.

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Test File Creation**: Create `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/agent-references-integrity.integration.spec.ts`

2. **Test Structure**: Follow established BDD patterns covering AC-3 requirements:
   - Feature: Agent Configuration References Integration
   - Scenario: Referential integrity enforcement across services
   - Component deletion prevention scenarios
   - Orphaned reference detection and cleanup

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Referenced component deletion prevention when dependencies exist
   - Component update compatibility validation with referencing configurations
   - Orphaned reference detection and appropriate handling workflows
   - Integrity violation guidance for resolution scenarios
   - Cross-service integrity constraint enforcement

4. **Integrity Constraint Testing**:
   - Prevent deletion of referenced personalities when agent configurations depend on them
   - Validate role updates maintain compatibility with existing agent references
   - Test model availability changes and impact on referencing agents
   - Validate integrity constraint enforcement across service boundaries

5. **Orphaned Reference Management**:
   - Detection of orphaned references after component deletions
   - Cleanup workflows for invalid references
   - Reference migration scenarios when components are updated
   - Integrity violation recovery and resolution guidance

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Integrity Enforcement Coverage

- ✅ Referenced component deletion prevented when dependencies exist with clear error messaging
- ✅ Component updates maintain compatibility with referencing configurations
- ✅ Cross-service integrity constraints enforced with proper coordination
- ✅ Integrity violations provide detailed guidance for resolution

### Orphaned Reference Management

- ✅ Orphaned references detected and handled appropriately with cleanup workflows
- ✅ Reference migration supported when components are updated or replaced
- ✅ Integrity violation recovery mechanisms provide clear resolution paths
- ✅ Cross-service orphaned reference detection and cleanup coordination

### Conflict Resolution

- ✅ Component lifecycle conflicts resolved with appropriate user guidance
- ✅ Reference update conflicts handled gracefully with rollback mechanisms
- ✅ Service coordination failures during integrity enforcement handled with proper cleanup

## Security Considerations

- Integrity enforcement respects authorization controls and access permissions
- Component deletion prevention validates user permissions for affected references
- Reference cleanup operations maintain audit trails for security compliance
- Cross-service integrity operations preserve security context and authorization

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: T-create-reference-dependency (dependency tracking foundation)
- **External**: PersonalityService, RoleService, ModelService lifecycle operations
- **Test Infrastructure**: Jest BDD framework, integrity constraint test utilities

## File Structure

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/
├── agent-references-integrity.integration.spec.ts (NEW)
```

## Testing Requirements

Include comprehensive unit tests for integrity enforcement logic within the same task:

- Component deletion prevention algorithms
- Orphaned reference detection logic
- Integrity constraint validation mechanisms
- Conflict resolution workflows
- Cross-service coordination error handling

## Implementation Notes

- Build on dependency tracking patterns from previous task
- Focus on component lifecycle management and integrity constraints
- Implement comprehensive orphaned reference detection and cleanup
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Test cross-service coordination for integrity enforcement scenarios
- Validate security and authorization aspects of integrity operations

### Log

**2025-07-28T02:56:02.365937Z** - Implemented comprehensive BDD integration tests for referential integrity enforcement across agent configuration services. Created agent-references-integrity.integration.spec.ts with extensive test coverage for component deletion prevention, compatibility validation, orphaned reference detection, integrity violation guidance, and cross-service enforcement. All tests use it.skip as per epic requirements and follow established BDD patterns with Given-When-Then structure. Tests include performance requirements validation (400ms integrity validation, 300ms deletion prevention), security context preservation, and comprehensive error scenario coverage. Implementation follows existing codebase patterns and includes proper TypeScript typing with all quality checks passing.
