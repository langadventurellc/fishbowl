# Role Management Validation Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for role validation business rules, capability constraints, and cross-role compatibility checking. These tests verify complex validation logic integrates correctly across service boundaries and ensures role definitions meet system requirements and business constraints.

## Key Components to Implement

- **Role Capability Validation**: Test capability definition validation against system constraints
- **Cross-Role Compatibility**: Verify role compatibility checking for agent configurations
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Test role-specific business rules and constraint validation
- **Validation Error Handling**: Ensure validation errors provide clear context and guidance

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Role Capability Constraint Validation

- **Given**: Role definitions with various capability configurations
- **When**: Capabilities are validated through constraint checking services
- **Then**: All capability constraints are enforced with appropriate validation feedback
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - System capability limits are enforced (max permissions, resource constraints)
  - Capability conflicts between different role aspects are detected
  - Invalid capability combinations trigger specific validation errors
  - Capability validation integrates with authorization and security services

### AC-2: Cross-Role Compatibility Integration

- **Given**: Multiple roles being used together in agent configurations
- **When**: Role compatibility is checked through validation services
- **Then**: Role conflicts and compatibility issues are identified and reported
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Conflicting role capabilities are detected across role combinations
  - Role hierarchy and precedence rules are enforced correctly
  - Compatibility validation considers both predefined and custom roles
  - Agent configuration validation integrates role compatibility checking

### AC-3: Role Business Rule Enforcement

- **Given**: Complex business rules governing role definitions and usage
- **When**: Role operations are processed through business rule validation
- **Then**: All business constraints are enforced with clear violation reporting
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Role naming conventions and standards are enforced
  - Role capability boundaries are validated against business requirements
  - Role lifecycle rules (creation, modification, archiving) are enforced
  - Business rule violations provide educational feedback and guidance

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Role Management Validation Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Validating role capability constraints", () => {
    it.skip("should enforce capability limits through validation service integration", async () => {
      // Given - Role with capabilities exceeding system limits
      // When - Validating role through capability constraint services
      // Then - Appropriate validation errors are generated with context
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Validation Pipeline Testing**: Test ValidationService, ConstraintService, and BusinessRuleService integration
- **Complex Scenario Coverage**: Test multi-role validation and compatibility scenarios
- **Error Context Validation**: Ensure validation errors provide actionable feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Test validation performance under various load scenarios

### Testing Requirements

#### Validation Integration Coverage

- ✅ Role capability constraint validation with system limit enforcement
- ✅ Cross-role compatibility checking for agent configurations
- ✅ Business rule validation with clear violation reporting
- ✅ Validation error handling with detailed context and guidance
- ✅ Performance validation for complex multi-role scenarios
- ✅ Validation service integration with caching and optimization

#### Error Handling Integration

- ✅ Capability constraint violations generate appropriate error messages
- ✅ Role compatibility conflicts are clearly identified and explained
- ✅ Business rule violations provide educational context
- ✅ Validation errors maintain context across service boundaries

## Security Considerations

- **Capability Security**: Role capabilities are validated for security implications and privilege escalation
- **Access Control Validation**: Role validation respects security policies and access controls
- **Input Sanitization**: Role validation data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Audit Compliance**: Validation decisions are logged for security auditing and compliance

## Performance Requirements

- **Validation Speed**: Role validation completes within 200ms for standard roles
- **Complex Scenarios**: Multi-role validation completes within 500ms
- **Constraint Checking**: Capability constraint validation completes within 100ms
- **Cache Efficiency**: Validation results are cached for improved performance

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-role-management-predefined-roles, F-role-management-custom-roles (role foundation and management)
- **External**: ValidationService, ConstraintService, BusinessRuleService, SecurityService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Validation builders, constraint fixtures, business rule scenarios
