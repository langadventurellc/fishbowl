# Implement File System Validation Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for file system integration with validation services, ensuring configuration data is validated before persistence and file operations integrate properly with validation workflows. This covers AC-2 from the feature requirements.

## Technical Approach

1. Test validation service integration before file persistence
2. Verify file format validation works with content validation
3. Ensure invalid configurations are prevented from file persistence
4. Test validation error context is maintained through file operations

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Test File Implementation

Create `configuration-file-validation-integration.integration.spec.ts` with the following BDD scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Pre-Persistence Configuration Validation

- **Given**: Configuration data requiring validation before file persistence
- **When**: Attempting to save configuration through ConfigurationService file integration
- **Then**: Configuration is validated completely before any file operations begin
- **Test Cases**:
  - Valid configurations proceed to file operations after validation
  - Invalid configurations are rejected before file operations start
  - Validation errors include detailed context about validation failures

#### Scenario 2: File Format and Content Validation Integration

- **Given**: Configuration files requiring both format and content validation
- **When**: File operations include integrated format and content validation
- **Then**: Both validation types work together to ensure complete data integrity
- **Test Cases**:
  - JSON format validation detects malformed file structure
  - Content validation verifies business rule compliance
  - Combined validation provides comprehensive error reporting
  - File format validation includes encoding and character set checks

#### Scenario 3: Invalid Configuration Prevention

- **Given**: Invalid configuration data that should not be persisted
- **When**: Attempting to write invalid configurations to files
- **Then**: Invalid configurations are completely prevented from file persistence
- **Test Cases**:
  - Schema validation failures prevent file writes
  - Business rule validation failures block persistence
  - File operations maintain transactional integrity during validation failures
  - No partial or corrupt configuration files are created

#### Scenario 4: Validation Error Context Preservation

- **Given**: Configuration validation errors during file operations
- **When**: Validation failures occur in the context of file operations
- **Then**: Error context maintains full traceability from file operations through validation
- **Test Cases**:
  - Validation errors include file path and operation context
  - Error messages preserve validation rule violations with field-level detail
  - Error stack traces include both file operation and validation components
  - Error context supports debugging and troubleshooting workflows

### Unit Testing Requirements

- Test validation service integration utilities work correctly
- Test file format validation functions handle various invalid formats
- Test validation error context preservation utilities
- Test integration between ValidationService and FileService components

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Configuration data is validated completely before any file persistence attempts
- [ ] File format validation integrates seamlessly with content validation
- [ ] Invalid configurations are completely prevented from being persisted to files
- [ ] Validation errors maintain full context from file operation attempts
- [ ] All test scenarios pass with proper BDD structure and clear assertions
- [ ] Unit tests verify all validation integration utilities work correctly
- [ ] Integration supports various configuration formats (JSON, YAML, etc.)
- [ ] Error handling provides detailed validation failure information

## Security Considerations

- Validation prevents injection attacks through configuration files
- File format validation prevents malicious payload execution
- Invalid configuration rejection protects against system compromise
- Validation error messages don't expose sensitive system information

## Performance Requirements

- Validation integration adds minimal overhead to file operations
- Large configuration files are validated efficiently with streaming
- Validation error reporting is fast and doesn't block operations
- Memory usage remains constant during validation of large files

## Dependencies

- Test infrastructure from T-set-up-configuration-service
- ValidationService interface for configuration validation
- FileService interface for file operations
- ConfigurationService for coordinated validation and file operations
- Configuration schema definitions for validation rules

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-validation-integration.integration.spec.ts`
- Unit test files for validation integration utilities
- Helper utilities for validation integration testing
- Test fixtures for valid and invalid configuration formats

### Log

**2025-07-28T21:38:57.583031Z** - Implemented comprehensive BDD integration tests for file system validation integration, covering all four required scenarios: pre-persistence validation, file format validation, invalid configuration prevention, and validation error context preservation. Created supporting test fixtures and mock factories to enable future implementation of actual validation and file services. All tests are properly structured with Given-When-Then comments and are initially skipped as required for the BDD testing infrastructure.
