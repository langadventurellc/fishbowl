# Create Comprehensive Test Fixtures and Configuration Data

## Context

Create comprehensive test fixtures and configuration data files that support all integration test scenarios for configuration service file operations, including valid configurations, invalid configurations, and various file operation scenarios.

## Technical Approach

1. Create structured JSON fixture files with realistic configuration data
2. Include both valid and invalid configuration examples for validation testing
3. Design file operation scenarios that cover edge cases and error conditions
4. Ensure fixtures support cross-platform testing and various file formats

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Test Fixture Files Creation

#### Valid Configuration Files (valid-configuration-files.json)

Create comprehensive collection of valid configuration examples:

- **Basic Configurations**: Simple key-value configurations for testing basic operations
- **Complex Nested Configurations**: Multi-level nested objects for testing complex scenarios
- **Array Configurations**: Configurations with arrays and lists for testing collection handling
- **Type-Diverse Configurations**: Configurations with strings, numbers, booleans, and null values
- **Large Configurations**: Configurations with substantial data for performance testing
- **Minimal Configurations**: Bare minimum valid configurations for edge case testing

#### Invalid Configuration Files (invalid-configuration-files.json)

Create collection of invalid configuration examples for validation testing:

- **Schema Violations**: Configurations that violate defined schemas and data types
- **Format Errors**: Malformed JSON and other format-specific errors
- **Business Rule Violations**: Configurations that violate application business rules
- **Constraint Violations**: Configurations that exceed limits or violate constraints
- **Missing Required Fields**: Configurations missing mandatory fields
- **Invalid Data Types**: Configurations with incorrect data types for fields

#### File Operation Scenarios (file-operation-scenarios.json)

Create scenarios for testing various file operations:

- **Atomic Operation Scenarios**: Test data for atomic write and rollback testing
- **Concurrent Access Scenarios**: Scenarios for testing file locking and concurrent operations
- **Backup and Recovery Scenarios**: Test cases for backup creation and file recovery
- **Cross-Platform Scenarios**: File operation scenarios with platform-specific considerations
- **Error Condition Scenarios**: Scenarios that trigger various error conditions
- **Performance Test Scenarios**: Large-scale scenarios for performance testing

### Fixture Data Structure Design

#### Configuration Schema Examples

- **Agent Configuration**: Realistic agent configuration examples with all required fields
- **Service Configuration**: Service-level configuration examples with proper structure
- **Integration Configuration**: Configuration examples for service integration scenarios
- **Security Configuration**: Configuration examples with security settings and permissions

#### File Operation Test Cases

- **Success Path Cases**: Normal operation scenarios that should succeed
- **Failure Path Cases**: Scenarios designed to test error handling and recovery
- **Edge Case Scenarios**: Boundary conditions and unusual but valid scenarios
- **Performance Test Cases**: Large-scale data for testing performance characteristics

### Unit Testing Requirements

- Test fixture loading utilities work correctly for all fixture files
- Test fixture data validation ensures all examples are properly structured
- Test fixture generation utilities create consistent test data
- Verify fixture data covers all test scenario requirements comprehensively

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Valid configuration fixtures include comprehensive examples for all test scenarios
- [ ] Invalid configuration fixtures cover all major validation failure types
- [ ] File operation scenarios support all integration test requirements
- [ ] Fixture data is properly structured and loads correctly in test environment
- [ ] All fixture files are valid JSON with proper encoding and formatting
- [ ] Unit tests verify fixture loading and validation utilities work correctly
- [ ] Fixtures support testing across different platforms and file systems
- [ ] Documentation explains fixture structure and usage for test development

## Security Considerations

- Test fixtures don't contain real secrets or sensitive configuration data
- Invalid configuration examples don't include potentially harmful payloads
- Fixture data is sanitized and safe for use in automated testing environments
- Test scenarios include security-focused validation examples

## Performance Requirements

- Fixture files load quickly without impacting test execution performance
- Large configuration examples are structured efficiently for testing
- Fixture data supports performance testing scenarios with realistic data volumes
- Memory usage for fixture data is optimized for test environment constraints

## Dependencies

- Test infrastructure from T-set-up-configuration-service
- JSON schema validation for ensuring fixture data correctness
- File system utilities for fixture file management
- Configuration validation logic for creating realistic test scenarios

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/fixtures/configuration-files/valid-configuration-files.json`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/fixtures/configuration-files/invalid-configuration-files.json`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/fixtures/configuration-files/file-operation-scenarios.json`
- Fixture loading and validation utilities
- Documentation for fixture structure and usage
- Unit tests for fixture utilities and data validation

### Log

**2025-07-28T22:00:16.330072Z** - Successfully created comprehensive test fixtures and configuration data for file operations integration testing. Enhanced all three fixture files with extensive validation scenarios, performance test data, stress testing scenarios, and cross-platform compatibility. Created FixtureValidationUtils class with schema validation, realistic data generation, and performance test capabilities. Updated ConfigurationTestFixtures class with new utility methods leveraging the enhanced fixtures. All quality checks (lint, format, type-check) pass successfully.
