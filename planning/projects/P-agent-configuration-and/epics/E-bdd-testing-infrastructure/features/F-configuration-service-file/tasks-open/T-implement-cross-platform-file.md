# Implement Cross-Platform File Operations Compatibility Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests to ensure configuration file operations work consistently across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), handling platform-specific file system differences, path separators, and permission models.

## Technical Approach

1. Test file operations across different platform path formats
2. Verify permission handling works correctly on different platforms
3. Ensure file locking mechanisms are compatible across platforms
4. Test file encoding and line ending handling for cross-platform consistency

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Test File Implementation

Create `configuration-file-cross-platform.integration.spec.ts` with the following BDD scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Cross-Platform Path Handling

- **Given**: Configuration files with paths that need to work across platforms
- **When**: File operations are performed using platform-specific path formats
- **Then**: Path handling works correctly regardless of platform path conventions
- **Test Cases**:
  - Windows-style paths (C:\\path\\to\\config) are handled correctly on all platforms
  - Unix-style paths (/path/to/config) work consistently across platforms
  - Relative paths are resolved correctly relative to application root
  - Path normalization handles mixed separators and resolve to correct platform format

#### Scenario 2: Platform-Specific Permission Management

- **Given**: Configuration files requiring appropriate security permissions
- **When**: Setting file permissions on different operating systems
- **Then**: Permission models work correctly according to each platform's capabilities
- **Test Cases**:
  - Unix/Linux/macOS permission model (rwx) is applied correctly
  - Windows ACL permissions are set appropriately when available
  - Permission fallbacks work when platform doesn't support specific permission models
  - File permissions are verified and enforced consistently across platforms

#### Scenario 3: Cross-Platform File Locking Compatibility

- **Given**: Configuration files requiring locking for concurrent access protection
- **When**: File locking is used on different operating systems
- **Then**: Locking mechanisms work reliably across all supported platforms
- **Test Cases**:
  - File locking prevents concurrent writes on Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Lock release works correctly on all platforms including process termination
  - Lock timeouts and error handling are consistent across platforms
  - Shared vs exclusive locks work according to platform capabilities

#### Scenario 4: File Encoding and Line Ending Consistency

- **Given**: Configuration files that may be edited on different platforms
- **When**: Files are created, read, and written across different platforms
- **Then**: File encoding and line endings are handled consistently
- **Test Cases**:
  - UTF-8 encoding is preserved across all platforms
  - Line endings are normalized appropriately (CRLF/LF) for platform consistency
  - Unicode characters in configuration files are handled correctly
  - File encoding detection works reliably for existing configuration files

### Unit Testing Requirements

- Test path normalization utilities work correctly for all platform formats
- Test permission handling utilities adapt appropriately to platform capabilities
- Test file locking utilities provide consistent behavior across platforms
- Test encoding and line ending utilities handle platform differences correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File paths work correctly regardless of platform path format conventions
- [ ] File permissions are set and enforced appropriately for each platform's capabilities
- [ ] File locking mechanisms provide consistent protection across all platforms
- [ ] File encoding and line endings are handled consistently across platforms
- [ ] All test scenarios pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
- [ ] Unit tests verify cross-platform utilities work correctly
- [ ] Platform-specific error handling provides appropriate error messages
- [ ] Performance remains consistent across different platforms

## Security Considerations

- Platform-specific permission models are applied correctly for security
- File access controls work appropriately for each platform's security model
- Path traversal prevention works across all platform path formats
- File locking prevents race conditions that could lead to security vulnerabilities

## Performance Requirements

- Cross-platform operations don't add significant performance overhead
- Platform-specific optimizations are used when available
- File operations perform comparably across different platforms
- Memory usage remains consistent regardless of platform

## Dependencies

- Test infrastructure from T-set-up-configuration-service
- Node.js path module for cross-platform path handling
- Platform-specific file system APIs for permission and locking
- File encoding detection libraries for consistent encoding handling
- Mock utilities for simulating different platform behaviors in tests

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-cross-platform.integration.spec.ts`
- Unit test files for cross-platform utilities
- Platform abstraction utilities for consistent file operations
- Test fixtures for different platform path and encoding scenarios
