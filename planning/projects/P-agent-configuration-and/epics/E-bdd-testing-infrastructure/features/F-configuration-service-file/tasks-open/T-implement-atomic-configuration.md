# Implement Atomic Configuration File Operations Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for atomic configuration file operations, focusing on atomicity guarantees, consistency maintenance, and proper rollback mechanisms when operations fail. This covers AC-1 from the feature requirements.

## Technical Approach

1. Use temporary file staging for atomic write operations
2. Test rollback mechanisms when validation or write operations fail
3. Verify concurrent access handling with file locking
4. Ensure file integrity validation before and after operations

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Test File Implementation

Create `configuration-file-atomic-operations.integration.spec.ts` with the following BDD scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Atomic File Write Operations

- **Given**: A configuration requiring atomic file updates
- **When**: Writing configuration data through FileService integration
- **Then**: File operations are atomic with temporary staging and safe replacement
- **Test Cases**:
  - Successful atomic write replaces original file safely
  - Failed write operations leave original file unchanged
  - Temporary files are cleaned up after both success and failure

#### Scenario 2: Rollback Mechanisms on Validation Failure

- **Given**: Configuration data that fails validation during file write
- **When**: Attempting to write invalid configuration through ConfigurationService
- **Then**: File write is aborted and original file is preserved
- **Test Cases**:
  - Validation failure triggers complete rollback
  - Original file content remains unchanged after rollback
  - No temporary files remain after failed operations

#### Scenario 3: Concurrent File Access Handling

- **Given**: Multiple processes attempting to access the same configuration file
- **When**: Concurrent file operations are performed
- **Then**: File locking prevents corruption and ensures operation ordering
- **Test Cases**:
  - Concurrent writes are serialized with proper locking
  - Read operations during writes receive consistent data
  - Lock timeouts are handled gracefully with appropriate errors

#### Scenario 4: File Integrity Validation

- **Given**: Configuration files requiring integrity validation
- **When**: File operations include pre and post-operation integrity checks
- **Then**: File corruption is detected and prevented
- **Test Cases**:
  - Checksum validation detects file corruption
  - Corrupted files trigger rollback to last known good state
  - Integrity validation includes file size and modification time checks

### Unit Testing Requirements

- Test atomic operation helper functions work correctly
- Test rollback mechanism utilities handle various failure scenarios
- Test file locking utilities prevent race conditions
- Test integrity validation functions detect corruption accurately

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All atomic file write operations use temporary staging with safe replacement
- [ ] Failed operations trigger complete rollback with original file preservation
- [ ] Concurrent file access is handled safely with appropriate locking mechanisms
- [ ] File integrity is validated before and after all operations
- [ ] All test scenarios pass with proper BDD structure and clear assertions
- [ ] Unit tests verify all helper functions and utilities work correctly
- [ ] Tests complete within 200ms performance requirement
- [ ] Error handling provides clear context and appropriate error types

## Security Considerations

- Temporary files are created with restrictive permissions
- File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal
- Atomic operations prevent partial writes that could be exploited
- File locking prevents race condition vulnerabilities

## Performance Requirements

- Atomic operations complete within 200ms
- File locking adds minimal overhead to operations
- Temporary file creation and cleanup is efficient
- Large configuration files are handled with streaming when needed

## Dependencies

- Test infrastructure from T-set-up-configuration-service
- ConfigurationService interface for file operations
- FileService interface for atomic file operations
- ValidationService for configuration validation during file operations

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-atomic-operations.integration.spec.ts`
- Unit test files for atomic operation utilities
- Helper utilities for atomic operation testing
