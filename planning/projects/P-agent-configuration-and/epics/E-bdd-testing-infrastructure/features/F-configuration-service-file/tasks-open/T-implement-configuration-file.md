# Implement Configuration File Lifecycle Management Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for configuration file lifecycle management, covering creation, updates, deletion, backup, and recovery operations while maintaining file system consistency and integrity. This covers AC-3 from the feature requirements.

## Technical Approach

1. Test complete file lifecycle from creation through deletion
2. Verify backup and recovery mechanisms work correctly
3. Ensure dependency checking prevents unsafe operations
4. Test metadata and permission management throughout lifecycle

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Test File Implementation

Create `configuration-file-lifecycle.integration.spec.ts` with the following BDD scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Configuration File Creation with Metadata

- **Given**: New configuration requiring file creation with proper metadata
- **When**: Creating configuration files through ConfigurationService integration
- **Then**: Files are created with appropriate metadata, permissions, and initial content
- **Test Cases**:
  - New configuration files include creation timestamp and version metadata
  - File permissions are set appropriately for security (readable/writable by owner only)
  - Initial configuration content is valid and properly formatted
  - File creation includes atomic operations to prevent partial creation

#### Scenario 2: File Updates with Backup and Version History

- **Given**: Existing configuration files requiring updates
- **When**: Updating configuration files through file service integration
- **Then**: Updates maintain backup copies and version history for recovery
- **Test Cases**:
  - File updates create backup copies before modification
  - Version history tracks changes with timestamps and change descriptions
  - Updated files maintain metadata consistency with previous versions
  - Large file updates use efficient streaming to minimize memory usage

#### Scenario 3: File Deletion with Dependency Checking

- **Given**: Configuration files that may have dependencies or references
- **When**: Attempting to delete configuration files
- **Then**: Deletion includes dependency checking and safe cleanup procedures
- **Test Cases**:
  - Dependency checking prevents deletion of files referenced by other configurations
  - Safe deletion removes files and associated metadata completely
  - Deletion cleanup includes removal of backup files and version history when appropriate
  - Failed deletions leave file system in consistent state

#### Scenario 4: File Recovery from Backup Systems

- **Given**: Configuration files requiring recovery from backup or version history
- **When**: Recovering files using backup and recovery mechanisms
- **Then**: Files are restored accurately with proper metadata and content integrity
- **Test Cases**:
  - Point-in-time recovery restores files to specific previous versions
  - Backup recovery maintains file metadata and permissions correctly
  - Recovery operations validate restored file integrity before completion
  - Recovery includes rollback capabilities if restored files fail validation

### Unit Testing Requirements

- Test file lifecycle management utilities handle all operations correctly
- Test backup and recovery mechanism utilities work reliably
- Test dependency checking utilities identify file relationships accurately
- Test metadata management functions maintain consistency

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Configuration file creation includes proper metadata, permissions, and validation
- [ ] File updates maintain backup copies and comprehensive version history
- [ ] File deletion includes dependency checking and complete cleanup procedures
- [ ] File recovery mechanisms restore configurations accurately from backups
- [ ] All lifecycle operations maintain file system consistency and integrity
- [ ] Unit tests verify all lifecycle management utilities work correctly
- [ ] Lifecycle operations support various configuration file formats
- [ ] Error handling provides clear context for lifecycle operation failures

## Security Considerations

- File creation uses secure permissions to prevent unauthorized access
- Backup files are protected with same security measures as original files
- File deletion securely removes sensitive configuration data
- Recovery operations validate file integrity to prevent malicious restoration

## Performance Requirements

- File creation operations complete efficiently with minimal system impact
- Backup operations don't significantly slow down file updates
- Dependency checking scales well with large numbers of configuration files
- Recovery operations restore files quickly without blocking other operations

## Dependencies

- Test infrastructure from T-set-up-configuration-service
- ConfigurationService interface for lifecycle coordination
- FileService interface for file operations
- BackupService interface for backup and recovery operations
- Dependency tracking system for file relationship management

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-file-lifecycle.integration.spec.ts`
- Unit test files for lifecycle management utilities
- Helper utilities for lifecycle testing and validation
- Test fixtures for lifecycle scenarios and dependency relationships
