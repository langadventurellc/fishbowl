# Set up Configuration Service File Operations Test Infrastructure

## Context

Create the foundational test infrastructure for configuration service file operations integration tests. This includes directory structure, test utilities, and shared fixtures needed for atomic file operations, validation integration, and lifecycle management testing.

## Technical Approach

1. Create the directory structure as specified in feature requirements
2. Set up temporary directory management utilities for isolated file testing
3. Create shared test builders and fixtures for configuration file scenarios
4. Implement file operation test utilities with proper cleanup mechanisms

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Directory Structure Creation

Create the following directory structure:

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/
├── configuration-file-atomic-operations.integration.spec.ts (placeholder)
├── configuration-file-validation-integration.integration.spec.ts (placeholder)
├── configuration-file-lifecycle.integration.spec.ts (placeholder)
└── configuration-file-cross-platform.integration.spec.ts (placeholder)

packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/fixtures/
├── configuration-files/
│   ├── valid-configuration-files.json
│   ├── invalid-configuration-files.json
│   └── file-operation-scenarios.json
```

### Test Infrastructure Components

1. **TemporaryDirectoryManager**: Utility for creating and cleaning up test directories
2. **ConfigurationFileBuilder**: Builder pattern for creating test configuration files
3. **FileOperationTestUtilities**: Shared utilities for file operation testing
4. **AtomicOperationFixtures**: Fixtures for testing atomic operations and rollback scenarios

### Unit Testing Requirements

- Test the TemporaryDirectoryManager creation and cleanup functionality
- Test ConfigurationFileBuilder generates valid test configurations
- Test FileOperationTestUtilities helper methods work correctly
- Verify fixtures load and provide expected test data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Directory structure is created with placeholder test files
- [ ] TemporaryDirectoryManager creates isolated test directories and cleans up properly
- [ ] ConfigurationFileBuilder creates valid test configuration data
- [ ] FileOperationTestUtilities provide reliable file operation helpers
- [ ] All test fixtures load successfully and contain valid test data
- [ ] Unit tests verify all infrastructure components work correctly
- [ ] Infrastructure supports cross-platform file operations (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Security Considerations

- Temporary directories use secure random names to prevent conflicts
- Test files are created with appropriate permissions
- All temporary files and directories are properly cleaned up after tests

## Dependencies

- Node.js fs/promises API for file operations
- jest testing framework for unit tests
- path utilities for cross-platform path handling
- tmp or similar library for secure temporary directory creation

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/` (directory)
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/fixtures/configuration-files/` (directory)
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/utilities/TemporaryDirectoryManager.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/utilities/ConfigurationFileBuilder.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/utilities/FileOperationTestUtilities.ts`
- Various fixture JSON files with test data
