# Configuration Service File Operations Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for configuration service file operations, focusing on configuration file management, atomic file operations, and file system integration with validation services. These tests verify file operations maintain consistency and integrate properly with configuration validation workflows.

## Related Functional Work

This feature tests the functionality defined in:

- **[E-configuration-management](../../../E-configuration-management/epic.md)**: FileService atomic operations, file system abstraction layer, and storage architecture implementation

## Key Components to Implement

- **Atomic File Operations**: Test configuration file operations maintain atomicity and consistency
- **File System Integration**: Verify file operations integrate correctly with validation and persistence services
- **Configuration File Management**: Test configuration file lifecycle including backup and recovery
- **Cross-Platform File Handling**: Ensure file operations work consistently across different platforms

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Atomic Configuration File Operations

- **Given**: Configuration file operations requiring atomicity and consistency
- **When**: File operations are performed through ConfigurationService integration
- **Then**: All file operations maintain atomicity with proper rollback on failures
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Configuration file writes are atomic with temporary file staging
  - File operation failures trigger appropriate rollback with original file restoration
  - Concurrent file access is handled safely with proper locking mechanisms
  - File integrity is validated before and after operations

### AC-2: File System Integration with Validation

- **Given**: Configuration files requiring validation before persistence
- **When**: File operations are coordinated with validation services
- **Then**: File operations integrate properly with configuration validation workflows
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Configuration data is validated before file persistence
  - File format validation is integrated with content validation
  - Invalid configurations are prevented from being persisted to files
  - Validation errors maintain context from file operation attempts

### AC-3: Configuration File Lifecycle Management

- **Given**: Configuration files requiring complete lifecycle management
- **When**: Lifecycle operations are performed through file service integration
- **Then**: All lifecycle stages maintain file system consistency and integrity
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Configuration file creation includes proper metadata and permissions
  - File updates maintain backup copies and version history
  - File deletion includes dependency checking and cleanup
  - File recovery mechanisms restore configurations from backups when needed

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Configuration Service File Operations Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Atomic configuration file updates", () => {
    it.skip("should perform atomic file updates with rollback on failure", async () => {
      // Given - Configuration file requiring atomic update
      // When - Updating file through ConfigurationService with validation
      // Then - File operation is atomic with proper rollback on validation failure
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **File System Testing**: Use temporary directories for isolated file operation testing
- **Atomic Operation Testing**: Focus on atomicity and consistency of file operations
- **Cross-Service Integration**: Test FileService coordination with ValidationService and ConfigurationService
- **Error Recovery Testing**: Verify file operation error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Testing Requirements

#### File Operations Coverage

- ✅ Atomic configuration file writes with temporary staging
- ✅ File operation rollback mechanisms on validation failures
- ✅ Concurrent file access handling with proper locking
- ✅ File integrity validation before and after operations
- ✅ Configuration file backup and recovery workflows
- ✅ Cross-platform file operation consistency

#### Integration Validation

- ✅ FileService integration with ConfigurationService coordination
- ✅ Validation service integration with file operation workflows
- ✅ File system error handling with proper context propagation
- ✅ File operation performance optimization with caching

## Security Considerations

- **File Permission Security**: Configuration files maintain appropriate permissions and access controls
- **File Integrity**: File operations include integrity checks to prevent corruption
- **Path Security**: File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Backup Security**: Configuration backups are protected with appropriate security measures

## Performance Requirements

- **File Operation Speed**: Configuration file operations complete within 200ms
- **Atomic Operation Overhead**: Atomic file operations add minimal performance overhead
- **Concurrent Access**: File locking mechanisms don't significantly impact performance
- **Large File Handling**: Large configuration files are handled efficiently with streaming

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-configuration-service-crud (configuration service foundation)
- **External**: ConfigurationService, FileService, ValidationService, BackupService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Temporary directory manager, file operation builders, atomic operation fixtures
