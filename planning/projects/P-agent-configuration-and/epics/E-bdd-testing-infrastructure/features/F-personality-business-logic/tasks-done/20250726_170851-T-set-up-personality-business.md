# Set up personality business logic test infrastructure and fixtures

## Context

This task establishes the foundational test infrastructure and fixtures needed for comprehensive personality business logic integration testing. The infrastructure will support testing complex trait interactions, scoring algorithms, and psychological model compliance.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Test Fixtures Creation

- **Location**: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/fixtures/`
- **Files to Create**:
  - `personality-trait-combinations.json` - Valid and invalid trait combinations for testing
  - `psychology-model-constraints.json` - Big Five model constraints and validation rules
  - `scoring-test-scenarios.json` - Personality scoring test data with expected results

### Test Infrastructure Setup

- **Location**: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/`
- **Infrastructure Components**:
  - Test helper utilities for business logic validation
  - Mock service configurations for BusinessRuleService, ScoringService, ValidationService
  - Base test setup for personality business logic scenarios

## Technical Approach

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Create fixture data structures**:

   ```typescript
   // personality-trait-combinations.json structure
   {
     "validCombinations": [
       {
         "id": "balanced-profile",
         "traits": { "openness": 65, "conscientiousness": 70, ... },
         "expectedValidation": "valid"
       }
     ],
     "invalidCombinations": [
       {
         "id": "extreme-neuroticism-low-conscientiousness",
         "traits": { "neuroticism": 95, "conscientiousness": 10, ... },
         "expectedError": "trait_interaction_warning"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Set up test infrastructure**:
   - Business rule test builders for creating test scenarios
   - Service mocking utilities for consistent integration testing
   - Helper functions for BDD test structure setup

3. **Create base test setup utilities**:
   - Common test configuration for personality business logic tests
   - Shared assertion helpers for business rule validation
   - Performance measurement utilities for rule evaluation timing

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ Test fixtures contain representative trait combinations for all test scenarios
- ✅ Psychology model constraints accurately reflect Big Five research requirements
- ✅ Scoring test scenarios cover edge cases and normal operation patterns
- ✅ Test infrastructure supports BDD-style test structure and assertions

### Performance Requirements

- ✅ Test fixture loading completes within 50ms
- ✅ Test infrastructure setup executes within 100ms per test suite

### Security Requirements

- ✅ Test fixtures contain no real user personality data
- ✅ Mock services properly isolate business logic testing from production services

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None - this is foundational infrastructure
- **External Services**: BusinessRuleService, ScoringService, ValidationService (mocked)
- **Test Framework**: Jest integration testing capabilities

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for fixture data validation and structure
- Integration tests for test infrastructure helper functions
- Performance tests for fixture loading and infrastructure setup timing

### Log

**2025-07-26T22:08:51.046108Z** - Successfully completed setup of personality business logic test infrastructure and fixtures. Moved test utilities out of **tests** directory to avoid Jest conflicts, resolved duplicate PersonalityScoringResult interfaces, and split multiple exports into individual files to satisfy linting rules. All test infrastructure files are now properly organized and tests are passing.
