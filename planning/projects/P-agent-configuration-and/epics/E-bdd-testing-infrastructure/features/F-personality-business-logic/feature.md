# Personality Business Logic Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for personality business logic enforcement, trait interaction rules, and psychological model constraints. These tests verify complex business rules are properly enforced across service integrations and ensure personality configurations adhere to psychological validity requirements.

## Key Components to Implement

- **Trait Interaction Validation**: Test business rules for trait combinations and psychological constraints
- **Personality Scoring Integration**: Verify personality scoring algorithms integrate with validation services
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Test business logic constraints across multiple service boundaries
- **Psychological Model Compliance**: Ensure personality configurations adhere to Big Five model requirements

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Trait Interaction Business Rules

- **Given**: Big Five personality traits with interdependency rules
- **When**: Personality configurations are processed through business logic services
- **Then**: Trait interaction rules are enforced with proper validation and error handling
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - High Neuroticism with low Conscientiousness combinations trigger validation warnings
  - Extreme trait combinations (all traits >90 or <10) are flagged for review
  - Trait correlation rules from psychological research are enforced
  - Invalid trait patterns are rejected with specific business rule explanations

### AC-2: Personality Scoring Integration

- **Given**: Personality trait values requiring composite scoring
- **When**: Scoring algorithms are applied through service integration
- **Then**: Scores are calculated consistently and validated against business constraints
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Overall personality compatibility scores are calculated correctly
  - Trait-specific subscores integrate with main personality scoring
  - Scoring results are validated against acceptable ranges
  - Score calculation errors are handled gracefully with fallback values

### AC-3: Psychological Model Compliance

- **Given**: Personality configurations claiming Big Five model compliance
- **When**: Configurations are validated through psychological model services
- **Then**: All configurations meet established psychological validity criteria
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Factor analysis requirements are validated for trait independence
  - Personality profiles meet statistical validity thresholds
  - Model compliance errors provide educational context about requirements
  - Research-backed constraint violations are clearly identified and explained

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Personality Business Logic Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Validating trait interaction rules", () => {
    it.skip("should enforce psychological trait constraints through service integration", async () => {
      // Given - Personality with potentially problematic trait combinations
      // When - Processing through business logic validation services
      // Then - Appropriate constraints are enforced with detailed feedback
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Business Logic Focus**: Test complex rule enforcement across service boundaries
- **Psychological Accuracy**: Use research-backed constraints and validation rules
- **Service Orchestration**: Test coordination between ValidationService, ScoringService, and BusinessRuleService
- **Error Context**: Ensure business rule violations provide educational feedback

### Testing Requirements

#### Business Logic Coverage

- ✅ Trait interaction rules enforcement with psychological accuracy
- ✅ Personality scoring integration with validation and error handling
- ✅ Constraint violation detection with appropriate severity levels
- ✅ Business rule exception handling with user-friendly explanations
- ✅ Psychological model compliance validation with research references
- ✅ Complex trait pattern recognition and classification

#### Integration Validation

- ✅ Business logic services coordinate properly with data persistence
- ✅ Scoring algorithms integrate seamlessly with validation pipelines
- ✅ Rule engine updates propagate correctly through service layers
- ✅ Business constraint changes are applied consistently across operations

## Security Considerations

- **Business Rule Integrity**: Business logic rules are protected from unauthorized modification
- **Validation Consistency**: Rule enforcement is consistent across all service entry points
- **Data Privacy**: Personality analysis respects user privacy and data protection requirements
- **Audit Trail**: Business rule enforcement decisions are logged for compliance review

## Performance Requirements

- **Rule Evaluation**: Business logic rules evaluate within 100ms for standard personalities
- **Scoring Performance**: Personality scoring completes within 200ms including all subscores
- **Complex Validation**: Multi-rule validation scenarios complete within 500ms
- **Cache Efficiency**: Frequently applied rules are cached for improved performance

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-personality-management-crud (basic personality operations)
- **External**: BusinessRuleService, ScoringService, ValidationService, PsychologyModelService
- **Test Infrastructure**: Business rule builders, psychology model fixtures, scoring test data
