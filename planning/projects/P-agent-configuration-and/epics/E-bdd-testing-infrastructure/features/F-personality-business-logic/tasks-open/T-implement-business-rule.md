# Implement business rule enforcement tests

## Context

This task implements comprehensive BDD integration tests for business rule enforcement across service boundaries. Tests verify that business rules are consistently applied, rule engine updates propagate correctly, and complex rule interactions are properly handled with audit trails and performance monitoring.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Primary Test File

- **Location**: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-business-rules.integration.spec.ts`
- **Testing Focus**: Business rule enforcement consistency and rule engine coordination across services

### Core Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Business Rule Consistency Across Services

```typescript
describe("Feature: Business Rule Enforcement", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Rule consistency across service boundaries", () => {
    it("should enforce business rules consistently across all service entry points", async () => {
      // Given - Same personality data processed through different service entry points
      // When - Business rules are applied through ValidationService and BusinessRuleService
      // Then - Rule enforcement is consistent regardless of service entry point
    });
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 2: Rule Engine Update Propagation

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Rule engine update propagation", () => {
  it("should propagate rule engine updates correctly through service layers", async () => {
    // Given - Business rule updates in the rule engine
    // When - Processing personality data through updated rule engine
    // Then - Rule changes are applied consistently across all service operations
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 3: Complex Rule Interaction Handling

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Complex rule interactions", () => {
  it("should handle complex rule interactions with proper precedence and resolution", async () => {
    // Given - Personality data triggering multiple interacting business rules
    // When - Processing through business rule service with complex rule sets
    // Then - Rule interactions are resolved with proper precedence and conflict resolution
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 4: Business Rule Audit Trail

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Business rule audit trail", () => {
  it("should log business rule enforcement decisions for compliance review", async () => {
    // Given - Personality processing with business rule enforcement
    // When - Rules are applied with enforcement decisions made
    // Then - Audit trail captures rule enforcement decisions for compliance review
  });
});
```

## Technical Approach

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Test rule consistency** across multiple service integration points
2. **Validate rule engine updates** ensure changes propagate through all service layers
3. **Test complex rule interactions** including precedence and conflict resolution
4. **Verify audit trail logging** for compliance and monitoring requirements

### Service Integration Testing

- **BusinessRuleService**: Test rule enforcement and rule engine coordination
- **ValidationService**: Test business rule integration with validation pipelines
- **AuditService**: Test audit trail generation for rule enforcement decisions

### Rule Engine Integration Testing

- Test rule updates and their propagation through service layers
- Validate rule precedence handling in complex scenarios
- Verify rule conflict resolution mechanisms

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Business Rule Enforcement Requirements

- ✅ Business rules are enforced consistently across all service entry points
- ✅ Rule engine updates propagate correctly through service layers
- ✅ Complex rule interactions are handled with proper precedence
- ✅ Business rule enforcement decisions are logged for compliance review
- ✅ Rule conflicts are resolved using established precedence mechanisms

### Performance Requirements

- ✅ Business rule evaluation completes within 100ms for standard rule sets
- ✅ Complex rule interaction processing completes within 300ms
- ✅ Rule engine update propagation completes within 500ms

### Integration Requirements

- ✅ Business rule services coordinate properly with validation and audit services
- ✅ Rule enforcement maintains data integrity during service failures
- ✅ Audit trail generation does not impact rule enforcement performance

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: T-set-up-personality-business (test infrastructure and business rule fixtures)
- **Services**: BusinessRuleService, ValidationService, AuditService
- **Test Data**: Business rule test scenarios, rule precedence configurations

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for business rule enforcement logic
- Integration tests for rule engine update propagation
- Performance tests for rule evaluation timing requirements
- Audit trail tests for compliance and monitoring functionality
