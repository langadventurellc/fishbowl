# Implement personality scoring integration tests

## Context

This task implements comprehensive BDD integration tests for personality scoring algorithms and their integration with validation services. Tests verify that scoring calculations are consistent, validated against business constraints, and properly handle error scenarios with fallback mechanisms.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Primary Test File

- **Location**: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-scoring-integration.integration.spec.ts`
- **Testing Focus**: Scoring algorithm integration with validation and business constraint enforcement

### Core Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Overall Personality Compatibility Scoring

```typescript
describe("Feature: Personality Scoring Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Overall compatibility scoring", () => {
    it("should calculate overall personality compatibility scores correctly", async () => {
      // Given - Multiple personality profiles for compatibility analysis
      // When - Processing through scoring service integration
      // Then - Compatibility scores are calculated correctly and within acceptable ranges
    });
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 2: Trait-Specific Subscore Integration

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Trait-specific subscoring", () => {
  it("should integrate trait-specific subscores with main personality scoring", async () => {
    // Given - Personality with individual trait scores requiring subscore calculation
    // When - Processing through scoring algorithm with trait-specific rules
    // Then - Subscores are calculated and properly integrated into overall scoring
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 3: Score Validation and Range Checking

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Score validation against constraints", () => {
  it("should validate scoring results against acceptable business ranges", async () => {
    // Given - Personality scoring results from algorithm processing
    // When - Validating scores through business constraint service
    // Then - Scores are validated against acceptable ranges with appropriate error handling
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 4: Scoring Error Handling and Fallbacks

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Scoring error handling", () => {
  it("should handle scoring calculation errors gracefully with fallback values", async () => {
    // Given - Personality data that causes scoring calculation errors
    // When - Processing through scoring service with error scenarios
    // Then - Errors are handled gracefully with appropriate fallback values and logging
  });
});
```

## Technical Approach

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Use scoring test scenarios** from fixtures for consistent test data
2. **Mock scoring service integration** to test calculation logic without external dependencies
3. **Validate score ranges and constraints** ensure business rules are properly enforced
4. **Test error handling paths** including calculation failures and invalid input scenarios

### Service Integration Testing

- **ScoringService**: Test personality scoring algorithm execution
- **ValidationService**: Test score validation against business constraints
- **BusinessRuleService**: Test scoring constraint enforcement

### Performance and Reliability Testing

- Verify scoring performance meets 200ms requirement including subscores
- Test scoring consistency across multiple executions
- Validate fallback mechanisms maintain system reliability

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-2: Personality Scoring Integration

- ✅ Overall personality compatibility scores are calculated correctly
- ✅ Trait-specific subscores integrate with main personality scoring
- ✅ Scoring results are validated against acceptable ranges (0-100 scale)
- ✅ Score calculation errors are handled gracefully with fallback values
- ✅ Scoring algorithms maintain consistency across multiple executions

### Performance Requirements

- ✅ Personality scoring completes within 200ms including all subscores
- ✅ Score validation executes within 50ms per scoring result
- ✅ Fallback value calculation completes within 100ms during error scenarios

### Integration Requirements

- ✅ Scoring service integrates seamlessly with validation pipelines
- ✅ Score calculation errors trigger appropriate logging and monitoring
- ✅ Business constraint violations in scoring are properly escalated

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: T-set-up-personality-business (test infrastructure and scoring fixtures)
- **Services**: ScoringService, ValidationService, BusinessRuleService
- **Test Data**: scoring-test-scenarios.json, psychology-model-constraints.json

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for scoring algorithm integration logic
- Integration tests for score validation and constraint checking
- Performance tests for scoring timing requirements (200ms total)
- Error handling tests for calculation failures and fallback scenarios
