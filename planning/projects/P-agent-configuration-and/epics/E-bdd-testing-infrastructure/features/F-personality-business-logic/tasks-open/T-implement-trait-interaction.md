# Implement trait interaction validation tests

## Context

This task implements comprehensive BDD integration tests for trait interaction business rules enforcement. Tests verify that psychological constraints and trait combination rules are properly validated across service boundaries, ensuring personality configurations meet research-backed psychological validity requirements.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Primary Test File

- **Location**: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-trait-interactions.integration.spec.ts`
- **Testing Focus**: Business rule enforcement for trait combinations and psychological constraints

### Core Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: High Neuroticism + Low Conscientiousness Validation

```typescript
describe("Feature: Trait Interaction Validation", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Problematic trait combinations", () => {
    it("should trigger validation warnings for high neuroticism with low conscientiousness", async () => {
      // Given - Personality with neuroticism >80 and conscientiousness <30
      // When - Processing through business logic validation services
      // Then - Validation warning is triggered with specific trait interaction explanation
    });
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 2: Extreme Trait Pattern Detection

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Extreme trait patterns", () => {
  it("should flag extreme trait combinations for review", async () => {
    // Given - Personality with all traits >90 or all traits <10
    // When - Validating through business rule service integration
    // Then - Extreme pattern flag is set with appropriate review recommendations
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 3: Trait Correlation Rule Enforcement

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Trait correlation rules", () => {
  it("should enforce research-backed trait correlation constraints", async () => {
    // Given - Personality with contradictory trait correlations
    // When - Processing through psychological validation service
    // Then - Correlation violations are identified with research references
  });
});
```

## Technical Approach

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Use test fixtures** from infrastructure task for consistent trait combination data
2. **Mock service integration** to test business logic without external dependencies
3. **Validate business rule responses** ensure proper error messages and validation warnings
4. **Test edge cases** including boundary conditions and invalid input scenarios

### Service Integration Testing

- **BusinessRuleService**: Test trait interaction rule enforcement
- **ValidationService**: Test psychological constraint validation
- **PsychologyModelService**: Test Big Five model compliance checking

### Error Handling Validation

- Verify specific business rule explanations are provided
- Test validation warning severity levels (warning vs error)
- Ensure educational context is included in rule violation messages

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Trait Interaction Business Rules

- ✅ High Neuroticism (>80) with low Conscientiousness (<30) triggers validation warnings
- ✅ Extreme trait combinations (all >90 or <10) are flagged for review
- ✅ Trait correlation rules from psychological research are enforced
- ✅ Invalid trait patterns are rejected with specific business rule explanations
- ✅ Business rule violations provide educational context about psychological requirements

### Performance Requirements

- ✅ Trait interaction validation completes within 100ms per personality
- ✅ Complex multi-rule validation scenarios complete within 300ms
- ✅ Business rule evaluation performs consistently under load

### Integration Requirements

- ✅ Business logic services coordinate properly through trait validation
- ✅ Validation results are properly structured and actionable
- ✅ Service error handling maintains data integrity during validation failures

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: T-set-up-personality-business (test infrastructure and fixtures)
- **Services**: BusinessRuleService, ValidationService, PsychologyModelService
- **Test Data**: personality-trait-combinations.json, psychology-model-constraints.json

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for trait interaction validation logic
- Integration tests for service coordination during trait validation
- Performance tests for validation timing requirements
- Error handling tests for invalid trait combination scenarios
