# Create Agent Configuration Error Handling and Validation Tests

## Context

Create comprehensive error handling and edge case validation tests for agent configuration creation workflows. Focus on error scenarios not covered in the main integration tests, including security validation, audit logging, and system resilience under various failure conditions.

## Technical Approach

- Create specialized tests for error scenarios and edge cases
- Focus on security considerations, audit logging, and system monitoring
- Test comprehensive error recovery and system stability
- Include advanced validation scenarios and constraint enforcement

## Implementation Requirements

### File Location

- Create: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/agent-creation-error-handling.integration.spec.ts`
- Complete comprehensive error scenario coverage for the feature

### Test Structure

Advanced error handling and validation scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Security Validation and Access Control

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Security validation during agent creation", () => {
  it("should enforce security validation for agent configurations", async () => {
    // Given - Agent configurations with security implications
    // When - Security validation is performed during creation
    // Then - Security constraints are enforced with proper access control
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 2: Audit Logging and Monitoring

```typescript
it("should log agent creation operations for security monitoring", async () => {
  // Given - Agent creation operations requiring audit trails
  // When - Agent creation workflows execute with monitoring
  // Then - Operations are logged for security monitoring and compliance
});
```

#### Scenario 3: Data Validation and Sanitization

```typescript
it("should sanitize and validate all agent configuration data", async () => {
  // Given - Agent configuration data requiring sanitization
  // When - Data validation and sanitization is performed
  // Then - All data is properly validated and sanitized before processing
});
```

#### Scenario 4: System Resilience Under Stress

```typescript
it("should maintain system stability under high error rates", async () => {
  // Given - High error rate scenarios and system stress conditions
  // When - Multiple error conditions occur simultaneously
  // Then - System maintains stability and continues operation
});
```

### Error Handling Testing Focus

#### Security Error Scenarios

- **Access Control Violations**: Test unauthorized agent creation attempts
- **Data Sanitization Failures**: Test malicious or malformed input handling
- **Permission Validation**: Test role-based access control enforcement
- **Security Constraint Violations**: Test security policy enforcement

#### System Resilience Testing

- **High Error Rate Handling**: Test system behavior under sustained error conditions
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Test behavior under resource constraint scenarios
- **Cascading Failure Prevention**: Test isolation of failures to prevent system-wide issues
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Test automatic recovery and system restoration

#### Advanced Validation Scenarios

- **Complex Constraint Violations**: Test intricate business rule enforcement
- **Cross-Service Validation Failures**: Test validation coordination failures
- **Performance Constraint Violations**: Test handling of performance requirement failures
- **Data Integrity Validation**: Test comprehensive data consistency checking

### Monitoring and Observability Testing

#### Audit Trail Validation

- **Creation Audit Logging**: Test comprehensive logging of agent creation operations
- **Security Event Logging**: Test security-related event capture and reporting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Test performance metric collection and analysis
- **Error Event Tracking**: Test error event capture and correlation

#### System Health Monitoring

- **Service Health Tracking**: Test health monitoring across all services
- **Performance Metric Collection**: Test comprehensive performance data collection
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Test error rate tracking and alerting
- **Resource Utilization Tracking**: Test resource usage monitoring and optimization

### Edge Case and Boundary Testing

#### Configuration Boundary Testing

- **Maximum Configuration Complexity**: Test system limits for complex configurations
- **Minimum Configuration Requirements**: Test enforcement of minimum requirements
- **Resource Limit Testing**: Test behavior at system resource boundaries
- **Concurrent Request Limits**: Test system behavior under concurrent load limits

#### Error Recovery Testing

- **Partial Recovery Scenarios**: Test recovery from partial system failures
- **State Restoration**: Test proper state restoration after error conditions
- **Service Recovery Coordination**: Test coordinated recovery across multiple services
- **Data Consistency Recovery**: Test data consistency restoration mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria
