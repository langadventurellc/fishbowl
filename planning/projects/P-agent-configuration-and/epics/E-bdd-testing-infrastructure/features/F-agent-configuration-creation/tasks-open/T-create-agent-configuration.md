# Create Agent Configuration Composition Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for agent configuration composition workflows, focusing on the integration of personality, role, and model configurations into complete agent definitions. Tests verify cross-service coordination and proper component integration.

## Technical Approach

- Follow existing BDD integration test patterns from personality-management and role-management features
- Use AgentService, PersonalityService, RoleService, and ModelService mocks for service coordination
- Create Given-When-Then scenarios that test component assembly and validation
- Include unit tests within integration scenarios following established patterns

## Implementation Requirements

### File Location

- Create: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/agent-creation-composition.integration.spec.ts`
- Follow existing integration test directory structure and naming conventions

### Test Structure

Following AC-1 from feature specification: "Agent Configuration Composition"

#### Scenario 1: Agent Creation with Personality and Role Integration

```typescript
describe("Feature: Agent Configuration Creation Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Creating agent with personality and role integration", () => {
    it("should create complete agent through cross-service coordination", async () => {
      // Given - Valid personality, role, and model configurations available through respective services
      // When - Agent creation workflow combines these components through service integration
      // Then - Complete agent configuration is assembled with proper validation and persistence
    });
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 2: Component Validation During Assembly

```typescript
it("should validate component compatibility during agent assembly", async () => {
  // Given - Mixed compatible and incompatible personality-role-model combinations
  // When - Agent assembly attempts to combine incompatible components
  // Then - Validation errors provide specific compatibility guidance
});
```

#### Scenario 3: Cross-Service Component Integration

```typescript
it("should integrate personality configurations through PersonalityService", async () => {
  // Given - Agent creation requires personality integration
  // When - AgentService coordinates with PersonalityService for personality data
  // Then - Personality configurations are properly integrated with validation
});
```

### Service Coordination Testing

- **PersonalityService Integration**: Test personality configuration retrieval and validation
- **RoleService Integration**: Test role configuration application and constraint checking
- **ModelService Integration**: Test model configuration validation and compatibility
- **ValidationService Integration**: Test cross-component validation and constraint enforcement

### Test Implementation Requirements

#### Mock Service Setup

- Configure AgentService, PersonalityService, RoleService, ModelService mocks
- Use realistic test data from fixtures for consistent scenarios
- Support both success and failure testing scenarios

#### Component Assembly Testing

- Test agent configuration assembly from multiple service components
- Validate cross-component compatibility and constraint checking
- Verify complete agent configuration structure and metadata

#### Validation Integration Testing

- Test cross-service validation during component assembly
- Verify validation error aggregation and context preservation
- Test validation success scenarios with component integration

#### Performance Testing

- Measure component assembly performance within acceptable limits
- Test component integration efficiency and response times
- Validate performance requirements from feature specification (1000ms creation, 200ms component integration)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Test Coverage Implementation

- ✅ Agent creation with personality and role integration through service coordination
- ✅ Model configuration integration with personality and role constraints
- ✅ Cross-service validation during agent creation workflow
- ✅ Component assembly with validation and compatibility checking
- ✅ Service coordination error handling and context preservation

### BDD Test Structure

- ✅ Given-When-Then structure following existing patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive scenario coverage for AC-1 requirements
- ✅ Service mock integration with realistic test data
- ✅ Unit tests included within integration scenarios
- ✅ Performance validation within specified limits

### Service Integration Testing

- ✅ PersonalityService integration during agent creation workflows
- ✅ RoleService integration with role validation and application

- ✅ Consistent with existing integration test patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive test documentation and context
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors

## Dependencies

- Requires completed AgentService and ModelService mock factories (prerequisites)
- Reference existing PersonalityService and RoleService mocks
- Use agent configuration types and validation patterns
- Integration with existing test infrastructure and fixtures
