# Create Agent Configuration Workflow Orchestration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for complete agent configuration workflow orchestration, focusing on end-to-end workflow coordination, performance optimization, and comprehensive error handling across all services. Tests verify complete workflow integration and system reliability.

## Technical Approach

- Test complete end-to-end agent creation workflows with full orchestration
- Focus on workflow performance, reliability, and comprehensive error handling
- Include advanced scenarios like concurrent workflows, complex configurations, and system stress testing
- Verify all performance requirements from feature specification

## Implementation Requirements

### File Location

- Create: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/agent-creation-workflow.integration.spec.ts`
- Complete the agent-configuration feature integration test suite

### Test Structure

Advanced workflow orchestration scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Complete End-to-End Workflow Orchestration

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Complete agent creation workflow orchestration", () => {
  it("should orchestrate complete agent creation with performance optimization", async () => {
    // Given - Complex agent configuration requiring full service orchestration
    // When - Complete workflow executes with all service coordination
    // Then - Agent is created within performance requirements with full optimization
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 2: Concurrent Workflow Management

```typescript
it("should handle multiple concurrent agent creation workflows", async () => {
  // Given - Multiple simultaneous agent creation requests
  // When - Workflows execute concurrently with resource management
  // Then - All workflows complete successfully with proper resource coordination
});
```

#### Scenario 3: Complex Configuration Workflow

```typescript
it("should handle complex agent configurations with advanced requirements", async () => {
  // Given - Agent configurations with complex personality, role, and model requirements
  // When - Advanced workflow orchestration manages complex configuration assembly
  // Then - Complex agents are created with comprehensive validation and optimization
});
```

#### Scenario 4: Workflow Error Recovery and Resilience

```typescript
it("should demonstrate workflow resilience under various failure conditions", async () => {
  // Given - Workflow execution under simulated failure conditions
  // When - Various failure scenarios occur during workflow execution
  // Then - Workflow demonstrates resilience with proper recovery and cleanup
});
```

### Advanced Workflow Testing
