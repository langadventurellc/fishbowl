# Create ModelService Interface for Model Configuration Validation

## Context

Following the established service interface pattern, create the ModelService interface to handle model configuration validation and compatibility checking for agent creation workflows. This service validates model configurations against personality and role requirements.

## Technical Approach

- Follow existing service interface patterns in `packages/shared/src/types/services/`
- Define model validation and compatibility checking methods
- Support model configuration constraints and capability validation
- Enable cross-service compatibility with personality and role configurations

## Implementation Requirements

### File Location

- Create: `packages/shared/src/types/services/ModelServiceInterface.ts`
- Export from: `packages/shared/src/types/services/index.ts`

### Interface Methods

1. **validateModelConfiguration(config: ModelConfiguration): Promise<ValidationResult>**
   - Validate model configuration against technical constraints
   - Check model availability and capability requirements
   - Return detailed validation results with error context

2. **checkModelCompatibility(modelConfig: ModelConfiguration, personalityConfig: PersonalityConfiguration, roleConfig: Role): Promise<CompatibilityResult>**
   - Cross-service compatibility validation
   - Verify model capabilities meet personality and role requirements
   - Return compatibility analysis with recommendations

3. **getModelCapabilities(modelId: string): Promise<ModelCapabilities | null>**
   - Retrieve detailed model capability information
   - Include performance characteristics and constraints
   - Return null for unknown or unavailable models

4. **listAvailableModels(filters?: ModelFilters): Promise<ModelConfiguration[]>**
   - List models available for agent configuration
   - Support filtering by capabilities, performance, or constraints
   - Return models suitable for current context

5. **validateModelConstraints(modelConfig: ModelConfiguration, constraints: ModelConstraints): Promise<ValidationResult>**
   - Validate model against specific operational constraints
   - Check performance, cost, and availability requirements
   - Return constraint compliance analysis

### Type Dependencies

Create supporting types:

- `ModelConfiguration` - Complete model configuration structure
- `ModelCapabilities` - Model capability and characteristic definition
- `ModelConstraints` - Operational constraint definitions
- `ModelFilters` - Model search and filtering criteria
- `CompatibilityResult` - Cross-service compatibility analysis result

### Documentation Requirements

- Comprehensive JSDoc for all interface methods
- Document model configuration validation rules
- Include compatibility checking algorithms and criteria
- Reference integration patterns with PersonalityService and RoleService

## Acceptance Criteria

### Interface Implementation

- ✅ ModelService interface created in correct location
- ✅ All required methods defined with proper TypeScript signatures
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation for each method
- ✅ Interface exported from services index file
- ✅ Supporting types (ModelConfiguration, ModelCapabilities, etc.) defined

### Cross-Service Integration Design

- ✅ Interface designed for PersonalityService compatibility checking
- ✅ Interface designed for RoleService requirement validation
- ✅ ValidationService integration for constraint checking
- ✅ Model capability validation patterns defined
- ✅ Error handling consistent with existing service patterns

### Validation Logic Design

- ✅ Model configuration validation rules defined
- ✅ Cross-service compatibility checking algorithms
- ✅ Performance and constraint validation patterns
- ✅ Model availability and capability checking
- ✅ Filtering and search capability support

### Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ✅ Consistent with existing service interface patterns
- ✅ Proper import/export structure
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors

## Dependencies

- Reference PersonalityConfiguration and Role types
- Review existing ValidationService patterns
- Understand cross-service compatibility requirements from feature specification

## File Structure

```
packages/shared/src/types/services/
├── ModelServiceInterface.ts (NEW)
├── AgentServiceInterface.ts (previous task)
├── RoleServiceInterface.ts (existing)
├── ValidationServiceInterface.ts (existing)
└── index.ts (UPDATE to export ModelService)
```

### Log

**2025-07-27T18:39:47.337887Z** - Created comprehensive ModelService interface for model configuration validation following established codebase patterns. Implemented all 5 required interface methods with supporting types using Zod schemas. Interface supports cross-service compatibility validation with PersonalityService and RoleService, model capability management, and constraint validation. All types compile successfully and follow existing patterns for validation, filtering, and cross-service integration. Files properly exported through barrel export pattern maintaining consistency with existing service interfaces.
