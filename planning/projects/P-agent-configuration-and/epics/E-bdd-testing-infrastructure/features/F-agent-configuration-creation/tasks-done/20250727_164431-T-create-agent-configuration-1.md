# Create Agent Configuration Validation Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for agent configuration validation workflows, focusing on cross-service validation coordination and constraint enforcement. Tests verify validation integration across personality, role, and model compatibility checking with detailed error reporting.

## Technical Approach

- Test AC-3 from feature specification: "Agent Configuration Validation Integration"
- Focus on cross-service validation coordination and constraint enforcement
- Include comprehensive validation error handling and context preservation
- Test validation performance within specified limits (300ms for cross-service validation)

## Implementation Requirements

### File Location

- Create: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/agent-creation-validation.integration.spec.ts`
- Follow established BDD integration test patterns

### Test Structure

Following AC-3: "Agent Configuration Validation Integration"

#### Scenario 1: Cross-Service Validation Coordination

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Cross-service agent configuration validation", () => {
  it("should validate agent configurations across personality, role, and model compatibility", async () => {
    // Given - Complex agent configurations with interdependent validation requirements
    // When - Validation is performed across personality, role, and model compatibility
    // Then - All validation constraints are enforced with clear error reporting
  });
});
```

#### Scenario 2: Personality-Role Compatibility Validation

```typescript
it("should validate personality-role compatibility through cross-service integration", async () => {
  // Given - Agent configurations requiring personality-role compatibility checking
  // When - Cross-service validation checks personality and role compatibility
  // Then - Validation results provide specific compatibility analysis and guidance
});
```

#### Scenario 3: Model Configuration Compatibility Validation

```typescript
it("should validate model configuration compatibility with personality and role", async () => {
  // Given - Model configurations that may conflict with personality or role requirements
  // When - Cross-service validation checks model compatibility
  // Then - Validation provides detailed compatibility analysis and recommendations
});
```

#### Scenario 4: Validation Error Context Preservation

```typescript
it("should preserve validation context across service boundaries", async () => {
  // Given - Complex validation failures spanning multiple services
  // When - Validation errors occur across service coordination
  // Then - Error context from originating services is maintained and aggregated
});
```

### Validation Testing Focus Areas

#### Cross-Service Validation Coordination

- **Personality-Role Validation**: Test personality and role compatibility algorithms
- **Model Compatibility**: Test model configuration against personality and role constraints
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Test comprehensive constraint validation across services
- **Validation Performance**: Ensure validation completes within 300ms requirement

#### Validation Error Handling

- **Error Aggregation**: Test validation error collection from multiple services
- **Context Preservation**: Verify error context maintains originating service information
- **Detailed Reporting**: Test specific guidance for constraint violations
- **Error Classification**: Test validation error categorization and prioritization

#### Compatibility Algorithm Testing

- **Personality-Role Matching**: Test personality trait and role requirement compatibility
- **Model Capability Matching**: Test model capabilities against personality and role needs
- **Constraint Conflict Detection**: Test identification of conflicting requirements
- **Compatibility Scoring**: Test compatibility analysis and recommendation algorithms

### Validation Scenarios

#### Valid Configuration Validation

- Test successful validation of compatible personality-role-model combinations
- Verify validation performance within specified time limits
- Test validation success reporting with compatibility scores

#### Invalid Configuration Validation

- Test personality-role incompatibility detection and reporting
- Test model configuration constraint violations
- Test complex multi-service validation failures

#### Edge Case Validation

- Test partial configuration validation (missing components)
- Test borderline compatibility cases with detailed analysis
- Test validation with deprecated or unavailable models

## Acceptance Criteria

### Cross-Service Validation Implementation

- ✅ Personality-role compatibility is validated through cross-service integration
- ✅ Model configuration compatibility with personality and role is verified
- ✅ Configuration constraint violations provide specific guidance for resolution
- ✅ Validation errors maintain context from originating services
- ✅ Cross-service validation completes within 300ms performance requirement

### Validation Error Reporting

- ✅ Detailed validation error messages with field-specific context
- ✅ Error aggregation across multiple service validation failures
- ✅ Validation context preservation across service boundaries
- ✅ Specific guidance for resolving configuration conflicts
- ✅ Error categorization and prioritization for user guidance

### Compatibility Algorithm Validation

- ✅ Personality-role compatibility algorithms provide accurate results
- ✅ Model capability validation against personality and role requirements
- ✅ Constraint conflict detection with detailed analysis
- ✅ Compatibility scoring and recommendation generation
- ✅ Performance optimization for complex validation scenarios

### Integration Testing Coverage

- ✅ PersonalityService validation integration within agent workflows
- ✅ RoleService constraint validation and enforcement
- ✅ ModelService compatibility checking with cross-service coordination
- ✅ ValidationService orchestration across all service boundaries
- ✅ Error handling and recovery during validation failures

## Dependencies

- Requires completed cross-service creation workflow tests (prerequisite)
- Use all service mock factories with validation capabilities
- Reference existing validation patterns from personality and role management
- Integration with ValidationService coordination patterns
