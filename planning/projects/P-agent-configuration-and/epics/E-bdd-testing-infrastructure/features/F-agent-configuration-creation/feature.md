# Agent Configuration Creation Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for agent configuration creation workflows, focusing on the composition of personality, role, and model configurations into complete agent definitions. These tests verify cross-service coordination and ensure agent creation integrates correctly with all dependent services.

## Key Components to Implement

- **Agent Composition Integration**: Test agent creation combining personality, role, and model configurations
- **Cross-Service Validation**: Verify agent configuration validation across multiple service boundaries
- **Configuration Assembly**: Test agent configuration assembly from component services
- **Creation Workflow Orchestration**: Verify complex agent creation workflows coordinate properly

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Agent Configuration Composition

- **Given**: Valid personality, role, and model configurations available through respective services
- **When**: Agent creation workflow combines these components through service integration
- **Then**: Complete agent configuration is assembled with proper validation and persistence
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Personality configurations are properly integrated through PersonalityService
  - Role configurations are validated and applied through RoleService
  - Model configurations are validated against agent requirements
  - Cross-component validation ensures configuration compatibility

### AC-2: Cross-Service Creation Workflow

- **Given**: Agent configuration creation requiring multiple service coordination
- **When**: Creation workflow orchestrates across PersonalityService, RoleService, and ModelService
- **Then**: All services coordinate properly with transaction-like consistency
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Service coordination maintains data consistency across creation workflow
  - Rollback mechanisms handle partial creation failures appropriately
  - Service communication errors are handled gracefully with proper cleanup
  - Creation workflow performance meets acceptable response time requirements

### AC-3: Agent Configuration Validation Integration

- **Given**: Complex agent configurations with interdependent validation requirements
- **When**: Validation is performed across personality, role, and model compatibility
- **Then**: All validation constraints are enforced with clear error reporting
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Personality-role compatibility is validated through cross-service integration
  - Model configuration compatibility with personality and role is verified
  - Configuration constraint violations provide specific guidance for resolution
  - Validation errors maintain context from originating services

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Agent Configuration Creation Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Creating agent with personality and role integration", () => {
    it.skip("should create complete agent through cross-service coordination", async () => {
      // Given - Valid personality, role, and model configurations
      // When - Creating agent through AgentService coordination
      // Then - Agent is created with all components properly integrated
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Cross-Service Integration**: Test AgentService coordination with PersonalityService, RoleService, and ModelService
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Focus on creation workflow coordination and error handling
- **Configuration Assembly**: Test complex configuration assembly from multiple sources
- **Transaction Consistency**: Verify creation workflow maintains data consistency

### Testing Requirements

#### Agent Creation Coverage

- ✅ Agent creation with personality and role integration through service coordination
- ✅ Model configuration integration with personality and role constraints
- ✅ Cross-service validation during agent creation workflow
- ✅ Creation workflow error handling with proper rollback mechanisms
- ✅ Agent configuration assembly with component validation
- ✅ Performance validation for complex agent creation scenarios

#### Integration Validation

- ✅ PersonalityService integration during agent creation workflows
- ✅ RoleService integration with role validation and application
- ✅ ModelService integration with configuration validation
- ✅ Cross-service transaction consistency and error handling

## Security Considerations

- **Configuration Security**: Agent configurations are validated for security implications
- **Access Control**: Agent creation respects user permissions and authorization policies
- **Data Validation**: All agent configuration data is sanitized and validated
- **Audit Logging**: Agent creation operations are logged for security monitoring

## Performance Requirements

- **Creation Speed**: Agent creation completes within 1000ms for standard configurations
- **Component Integration**: Individual component integration completes within 200ms
- **Validation Performance**: Cross-service validation completes within 300ms
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Creation workflow minimizes cross-service communication overhead

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-personality-management-crud (personality integration), F-role-management-predefined-roles (role integration)
- **External**: AgentService, PersonalityService, RoleService, ModelService, ValidationService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Agent builders, configuration fixtures, cross-service mock coordination
