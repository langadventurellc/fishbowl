# Personality Template Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement BDD integration tests for personality template loading, validation, and management. These tests verify template file operations integrate correctly with personality validation services and ensure consistent behavior across template-based personality creation workflows.

## Key Components to Implement

- **Template Loading Integration**: Test file operations for loading personality templates with validation
- **Template Validation Pipeline**: Verify template data flows correctly through validation services
- **Custom vs Template Differentiation**: Test system distinguishes between template and custom personalities
- **Template Transformation Logic**: Verify template data is properly transformed for personality service consumption

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Template File Integration

- **Given**: Personality template files in standardized JSON format
- **When**: Templates are loaded through file service integration
- **Then**: Template data is properly parsed, validated, and made available to personality services
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Template files are loaded from configured directory paths
  - JSON parsing errors are handled gracefully with detailed error context
  - Template metadata (version, author, description) is preserved and accessible
  - File system operations use temporary directories for test isolation

### AC-2: Template Validation Integration

- **Given**: Loaded personality template data
- **When**: Templates are processed through validation services
- **Then**: Template data passes through same validation pipeline as custom personalities
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Big Five trait values in templates are validated against business rules
  - Template-specific validation rules (immutability, versioning) are enforced
  - Invalid templates trigger appropriate validation errors with template context
  - Template validation integrates with personality service validation layer

### AC-3: Template vs Custom Personality Integration

- **Given**: System with both template and custom personality capabilities
- **When**: Operations are performed on different personality types
- **Then**: System correctly differentiates and handles template vs custom personalities
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Template personalities are marked as immutable during service operations
  - Custom personalities derived from templates maintain template reference
  - Template updates don't affect derived custom personalities
  - Service layer correctly routes operations based on personality type

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Personality Template Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Loading valid personality template", () => {
    it.skip("should load template through file service and validate data", async () => {
      // Given - Valid personality template file in temporary directory
      // When - Loading template through file service integration
      // Then - Template data is parsed, validated, and accessible
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **File System Testing**: Use temporary directories for template file operations
- **Service Integration**: Test FileService, TemplateService, and ValidationService coordination
- **Template Data Management**: Use realistic template fixtures with comprehensive trait definitions
- **Error Propagation**: Verify file errors propagate correctly through service layers

### Testing Requirements

#### Template Integration Coverage

- ✅ Template file loading with proper JSON parsing and validation
- ✅ Template metadata extraction and preservation during loading
- ✅ Template validation through personality validation pipeline
- ✅ Template immutability enforcement in service operations
- ✅ Custom personality derivation from template sources
- ✅ Template versioning and compatibility checking

#### Error Handling Integration

- ✅ Malformed template files trigger appropriate parsing errors
- ✅ Invalid template data fails validation with detailed context
- ✅ Missing template files are handled gracefully
- ✅ Permission errors during template loading are properly reported

## Security Considerations

- **File Path Validation**: Template file paths are sanitized to prevent directory traversal
- **Template Integrity**: Template checksums verify file integrity during loading
- **Access Control**: Template operations respect file system permissions
- **Input Sanitization**: Template data is sanitized before processing through services

## Performance Requirements

- **Template Loading**: Template files load within 200ms for standard-sized templates
- **Validation Performance**: Template validation completes within 100ms per template
- **Cache Efficiency**: Frequently accessed templates are cached for improved performance
- **Memory Management**: Template loading doesn't cause memory leaks during test execution

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-personality-management-crud (personality validation and service integration)
- **External**: FileService, TemplateService, ValidationService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Temporary directory manager, template fixture files, test data builders
