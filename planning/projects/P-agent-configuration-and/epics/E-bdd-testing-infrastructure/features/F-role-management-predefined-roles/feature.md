# Role Management Predefined Roles Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for predefined role management, focusing on the 10 predefined roles with immutability enforcement and file-based loading. These tests verify role service integration with file operations, validation services, and ensure predefined roles maintain their integrity across system operations.

## Key Components to Implement

- **Predefined Role Loading**: Test file-based loading of 10 predefined roles with validation
- **Immutability Enforcement**: Verify predefined roles cannot be modified through service operations
- **Role Metadata Integration**: Test role metadata (description, capabilities, constraints) is properly loaded and accessible
- **Role Service Coordination**: Verify RoleService integrates correctly with FileService and ValidationService

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Predefined Role File Integration

- **Given**: 10 predefined role definition files in standardized format
- **When**: Roles are loaded through file service integration
- **Then**: All predefined roles are correctly parsed, validated, and available through role services
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - All 10 predefined roles load successfully from configuration files
  - Role definitions include complete metadata (name, description, capabilities, constraints)
  - File parsing errors are handled gracefully with detailed error context
  - Role loading integrates with file system abstraction for testability

### AC-2: Immutability Enforcement Integration

- **Given**: Loaded predefined roles in role management system
- **When**: Modification operations are attempted through service layer
- **Then**: Predefined roles remain immutable with appropriate error responses
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Update operations on predefined roles are rejected with clear error messages
  - Delete operations on predefined roles are prevented with business rule explanations
  - Role immutability is enforced at service layer, not just UI layer
  - Immutability constraints propagate correctly through all service methods

### AC-3: Role Metadata and Capabilities Integration

- **Given**: Predefined roles with rich metadata and capability definitions
- **When**: Role metadata is accessed through service integration
- **Then**: All role attributes are properly exposed and validated through service APIs
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Role capabilities are properly parsed and validated against system requirements
  - Role constraints are enforced during agent configuration workflows
  - Role descriptions and metadata are accessible for UI integration
  - Role versioning information is preserved and accessible

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Role Management Predefined Roles Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Loading predefined roles from files", () => {
    it.skip("should load all 10 predefined roles through file service integration", async () => {
      // Given - Predefined role files in temporary directory
      // When - Loading roles through RoleService and FileService integration
      // Then - All roles are loaded, validated, and accessible
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **File System Integration**: Use temporary directories with realistic predefined role files
- **Service Layer Testing**: Focus on RoleService, FileService, and ValidationService coordination
- **Immutability Verification**: Test modification attempts are properly rejected
- **Metadata Validation**: Ensure role metadata flows correctly through service layers

### Testing Requirements

#### Predefined Role Coverage

- ✅ All 10 predefined roles load correctly from file system
- ✅ Role metadata (name, description, capabilities) is properly parsed
- ✅ Role constraints and requirements are validated during loading
- ✅ Role immutability is enforced across all service operations
- ✅ Role versioning and compatibility are handled correctly
- ✅ File system errors during role loading are handled gracefully

#### Service Integration Validation

- ✅ RoleService integrates properly with FileService for role loading
- ✅ ValidationService validates role definitions during loading
- ✅ Role data flows correctly between service layers
- ✅ Error propagation maintains context across service boundaries

## Security Considerations

- **Role Definition Integrity**: Predefined role files are protected from unauthorized modification
- **Access Control**: Role loading respects file system permissions and security constraints
- **Validation Security**: Role definitions are validated for security vulnerabilities
- **Audit Logging**: Role loading operations are logged for security monitoring

## Performance Requirements

- **Role Loading Speed**: All 10 predefined roles load within 300ms
- **Individual Role Access**: Role metadata retrieval completes within 50ms
- **Cache Efficiency**: Frequently accessed roles are cached for improved performance
- **Memory Management**: Role loading doesn't cause memory leaks during repeated operations

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: None (foundational role management functionality)
- **External**: RoleService, FileService, ValidationService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Temporary directory manager, predefined role fixtures, mock factories
