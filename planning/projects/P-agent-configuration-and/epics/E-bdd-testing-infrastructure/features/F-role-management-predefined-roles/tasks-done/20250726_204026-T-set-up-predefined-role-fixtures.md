# Set up predefined role fixtures and test infrastructure

## Context

This task establishes the foundational testing infrastructure for predefined role management integration tests. It creates realistic role fixtures, temporary directory management, and mock factories that other integration tests will use.

## Technical Approach

- Create 10 predefined role fixture files in JSON format with complete metadata
- Implement temporary directory helper for file system isolation during tests
- Set up mock factories for service interfaces (RoleService, FileService, ValidationService)
- Configure Jest integration test environment and file paths

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Create Predefined Role Fixtures

Create 10 predefined role files in `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/fixtures/predefined-roles/`:

- `analyst-role.json`: Data analysis and insights role
- `creative-role.json`: Creative and design role
- `developer-role.json`: Software development role
- `manager-role.json`: Project and team management role
- `researcher-role.json`: Research and investigation role
- `strategist-role.json`: Strategic planning role
- `facilitator-role.json`: Meeting and collaboration facilitation role
- `critic-role.json`: Critical analysis and review role
- `innovator-role.json`: Innovation and ideation role
- `advisor-role.json`: Advisory and consulting role

Each fixture should include:

```json
{
  "id": "role-analyst",
  "name": "Analyst",
  "description": "Focuses on data analysis and insights",
  "capabilities": ["data-analysis", "reporting", "visualization"],
  "constraints": ["no-creative-tasks", "structured-output"],
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "isPredefined": true,
    "category": "analytical"
  }
}
```

### Implement Test Infrastructure Helpers

Create `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/helpers/`:

- `temporaryDirectory.ts`: Helper for creating and cleaning up temp directories
- `mockFactories.ts`: Factory functions for creating service mocks
- `roleFixtures.ts`: Helper to load and manage role fixture data

### Configure Integration Test Structure

- Set up `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/role-management/` directory
- Create base test configuration and setup files
- Ensure proper TypeScript configuration for integration tests

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Complete Predefined Role Fixtures

- **Given**: 10 predefined role definition files are needed for testing
- **When**: Role fixtures are created with complete metadata
- **Then**: All 10 roles include valid JSON structure with id, name, description, capabilities, constraints, and metadata
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Each role file is valid JSON and parseable
  - Role definitions include diverse capabilities and constraints for testing variety
  - Metadata includes version, isPredefined flag, and category classification
  - Role names and descriptions are realistic and appropriate for testing scenarios

### AC-2: Temporary Directory Management

- **Given**: Integration tests need file system isolation
- **When**: Temporary directory helper is implemented
- **Then**: Tests can create and clean up isolated directories for each test run
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Helper creates unique temporary directories for each test execution
  - Automatic cleanup occurs after test completion
  - Directory permissions are properly configured for read/write operations
  - Error handling for directory creation and cleanup failures

### AC-3: Service Mock Factories

- **Given**: Integration tests need controlled service dependencies
- **When**: Mock factories are implemented for service interfaces
- **Then**: Tests can create consistent, configurable mocks for RoleService, FileService, and ValidationService
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Factory functions create mocks with realistic method signatures
  - Mocks support configuration for success/failure scenarios
  - Service mocks include proper TypeScript types and interfaces
  - Mock behavior is predictable and testable

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: None (foundational infrastructure task)
- **External**: Jest testing framework, Node.js file system APIs
- **Test Infrastructure**: Jest configuration, TypeScript test setup

```

## Security Considerations

- Fixture files contain no sensitive data, only test role definitions
- Temporary directories use secure permissions and are properly isolated
- Mock factories don't expose real service credentials or endpoints
- File system operations are contained within test directories

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for temporary directory helper to ensure proper cleanup
- Unit tests for mock factory functions to verify correct mock creation
- Integration test setup validation to ensure fixtures load correctly
- Verify all 10 role fixtures are valid JSON and contain required fields

### Log

**2025-07-27T01:40:26.991669Z** - Successfully implemented comprehensive predefined role fixtures and test infrastructure for BDD testing. Created 10 detailed predefined role fixtures (analyst, creative, developer, manager, researcher, strategist, facilitator, critic, innovator, advisor) with realistic capabilities and constraints. Implemented role-specific mock factories (RoleService, FileService, RoleValidationService) with configurable behavior for success/failure scenarios. Created RoleFixtureManager helper with loading, validation, caching, and test data building capabilities. Added comprehensive unit tests (19 passing tests) validating all fixture loading, validation, caching, and builder functionality. Updated Jest configuration for proper ESM TypeScript support. All quality checks pass (lint, format, type-check) and tests run successfully.
