# Implement immutability enforcement integration tests for predefined roles

## Context

This task implements comprehensive BDD integration tests for predefined role immutability enforcement. Tests verify that predefined roles cannot be modified through service operations and that immutability constraints are properly enforced at the service layer with appropriate error responses.

## Technical Approach

- Create integration test file: `role-predefined-immutability.integration.spec.ts`
- Test modification attempts on predefined roles through service layer
- Verify immutability enforcement produces appropriate error messages and business rule explanations
- Test that role immutability is enforced consistently across all service methods
- Include edge cases and boundary testing for immutability rules

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### BDD Test Structure

Create `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/role-management/role-predefined-immutability.integration.spec.ts` with:

```typescript
describe("Feature: Role Management Predefined Roles Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Immutability enforcement for predefined roles", () => {
    it.skip("should reject update operations on predefined roles with clear error messages", async () => {
      // Given - Loaded predefined roles in role management system
      // When - Update operations are attempted through service layer
      // Then - Operations are rejected with business rule explanations
    });

    it.skip("should prevent delete operations on predefined roles with appropriate errors", async () => {
      // Given - Predefined roles available in the system
      // When - Delete operations are attempted through service layer
      // Then - Operations are blocked with immutability error messages
    });

    it.skip("should enforce immutability across all service modification methods", async () => {
      // Given - Various service methods that modify role data
      // When - Any modification method is called on predefined roles
      // Then - All methods consistently enforce immutability rules
    });
  });

  describe("Scenario: Immutability error messaging and business rules", () => {
    it.skip("should provide clear error context when modifications are attempted", async () => {
      // Given - Specific predefined role modification attempts
      // When - Service operations are blocked by immutability rules
      // Then - Error messages include context about why operation failed
    });
  });
});
```

### Service Layer Immutability Testing

- Test update operations (name, description, capabilities, constraints modifications)
- Test delete operations and cascading effects
- Test bulk operations that might include predefined roles
- Verify immutability at service boundary, not just UI layer
- Test service method consistency in immutability enforcement

### Error Response Validation

- Verify appropriate error types and codes for immutability violations
- Test error message clarity and business rule explanations
- Validate error context includes specific role information
- Test error propagation through service layers
- Verify error handling doesn't expose internal implementation details

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Update Operation Rejection

- **Given**: Loaded predefined roles in role management system
- **When**: Update operations are attempted through service layer (name, description, capabilities, constraints)
- **Then**: Predefined roles remain immutable with appropriate error responses
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Service layer rejects updateRole() calls for predefined roles
  - Error messages clearly explain that predefined roles cannot be modified
  - Original role data remains unchanged after failed modification attempts
  - Error response includes role ID and specific field that was attempted to be changed
  - Update attempts return consistent error format across all predefined roles

### AC-2: Delete Operation Prevention

- **Given**: Predefined roles available in the system
- **When**: Delete operations are attempted through service layer
- **Then**: Predefined roles are protected with business rule explanations
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Service layer rejects deleteRole() calls for predefined roles
  - Error messages explain business reasoning for immutability (system stability, user expectations)
  - Cascade delete operations skip predefined roles and continue with custom roles
  - Bulk delete operations report which roles were skipped due to immutability
  - Role references and dependencies remain intact after failed delete attempts

### AC-3: Service Method Consistency

- **Given**: Multiple service methods that can modify role data
- **When**: Any modification method is called on predefined roles
- **Then**: All methods consistently enforce immutability constraints
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - updateRole(), deleteRole(), bulkUpdateRoles(), bulkDeleteRoles() all enforce immutability
  - Patch operations and partial updates are blocked for predefined roles
  - Import/export operations preserve predefined role immutability
  - Role cloning creates mutable copies while preserving original predefined roles
  - Service method signatures and contracts consistently handle immutability rules

### AC-4: Error Context and Business Rules

- **Given**: Specific predefined role modification attempts
- **When**: Service operations are blocked by immutability rules
- **Then**: Error messages provide clear context and business rule explanations
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Error messages include role name and ID for user recognition
  - Business rule explanations describe why predefined roles are immutable
  - Error responses include suggested alternatives (clone role, create custom role)
  - Error codes are consistent and machine-readable for client applications
  - Error context helps users understand system behavior and next steps

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: T-implement-role-loading (role loading functionality and service setup)
- **External**: RoleService with update/delete methods, error handling framework
- **Test Infrastructure**: Jest, role fixtures, service mocks, error assertion helpers

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Setup Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Role Management Predefined Roles Integration", () => {
  let roleService: RoleService;
  let predefinedRoles: Role[];

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Set up services and load predefined roles
    await setupServicesWithRoleFixtures();
    predefinedRoles = await roleService.loadPredefinedRoles();
  });

  describe("Scenario: Immutability enforcement for predefined roles", () => {
    it.skip("should reject update operations on predefined roles", async () => {
      const analystRole = predefinedRoles.find((r) => r.id === "role-analyst");

      await expect(
        roleService.updateRole(analystRole.id, { name: "Modified Analyst" }),
      ).rejects.toMatchObject({
        code: "PREDEFINED_ROLE_IMMUTABLE",
        message: expect.stringContaining("predefined roles cannot be modified"),
        roleId: "role-analyst",
      });
    });
  });
});
```

### Expected Service Interface for Immutability

Define expected service methods and error handling:

- `RoleService.updateRole(id: string, updates: Partial<Role>): Promise<Role>`
- `RoleService.deleteRole(id: string): Promise<void>`
- `RoleService.bulkUpdateRoles(updates: RoleUpdate[]): Promise<RoleUpdateResult[]>`
- Error types: `PREDEFINED_ROLE_IMMUTABLE`, `OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED`

### Immutability Test Scenarios

Test comprehensive immutability enforcement:

- Individual field updates (name, description, capabilities, constraints)
- Complete role replacement attempts
- Bulk operations containing mix of predefined and custom roles
- Edge cases with partial data and malformed requests

## Files to Create/Modify

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/role-management/
└── role-predefined-immutability.integration.spec.ts

packages/shared/src/services/ (error handling for immutability)
├── RoleService.ts (update/delete methods with immutability checks)
└── errors/
    ├── RoleImmutabilityError.ts
    └── ErrorCodes.ts
```

## Error Handling Requirements

- Consistent error format across all immutability violations
- Clear error messages that explain business rules to users
- Error codes that allow programmatic handling by client applications
- Error context that includes role information and suggested alternatives
- Proper error inheritance and type safety for TypeScript clients

## Security Considerations

- Immutability enforcement prevents unauthorized modification of system roles
- Error messages don't expose internal system details or file paths
- Service layer validation occurs before any data persistence attempts
- Audit logging for immutability violation attempts for security monitoring

## Testing Requirements

- Integration tests cover all service methods that modify role data
- Error condition tests verify appropriate error types and messages
- Boundary tests ensure immutability rules are consistently applied
- Performance tests verify immutability checks don't impact system performance
- Service contract tests ensure error handling meets API specifications
