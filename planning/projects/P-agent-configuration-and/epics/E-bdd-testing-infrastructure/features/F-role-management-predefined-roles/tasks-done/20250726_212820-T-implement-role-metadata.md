# Implement role metadata validation and service coordination integration tests

## Context

This task implements comprehensive BDD integration tests for role metadata validation and service coordination. Tests verify that role metadata (capabilities, constraints, descriptions) is properly validated, accessible through service APIs, and that service coordination between RoleService, FileService, and ValidationService works correctly with proper error propagation.

## Technical Approach

- Create integration test file: `role-predefined-metadata.integration.spec.ts`
- Test role metadata validation during loading and access operations
- Verify service coordination patterns and error propagation across service boundaries
- Test metadata accessibility and query operations through service APIs
- Include comprehensive validation testing for role capabilities and constraints

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### BDD Test Structure

Create `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/role-management/role-predefined-metadata.integration.spec.ts` with:

```typescript
describe("Feature: Role Management Predefined Roles Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Role metadata validation during loading", () => {
    it.skip("should validate role capabilities against system requirements", async () => {
      // Given - Predefined roles with capability definitions
      // When - Roles are loaded and validated through service integration
      // Then - Capabilities are validated and accessible through service APIs
    });

    it.skip("should enforce role constraints during agent configuration workflows", async () => {
      // Given - Predefined roles with constraint definitions
      // When - Role constraints are accessed for agent configuration
      // Then - Constraints are properly enforced and validated
    });

    it.skip("should preserve role versioning information during loading", async () => {
      // Given - Predefined roles with version metadata
      // When - Roles are processed through service layers
      // Then - Version information is preserved and queryable
    });
  });

  describe("Scenario: Service coordination and error propagation", () => {
    it.skip("should coordinate between RoleService, FileService, and ValidationService", async () => {
      // Given - Integrated service layer with proper dependencies
      // When - Role operations flow through multiple services
      // Then - Services coordinate correctly with clean data flow
    });

    it.skip("should propagate validation errors with proper context across services", async () => {
      // Given - Invalid role data or validation failures
      // When - Errors occur during service coordination
      // Then - Error context is maintained across service boundaries
    });
  });

  describe("Scenario: Metadata accessibility through service APIs", () => {
    it.skip("should expose role metadata through consistent service interfaces", async () => {
      // Given - Successfully loaded roles with complete metadata
      // When - Metadata is accessed through various service methods
      // Then - All role attributes are properly accessible and typed
    });
  });
});
```

### Metadata Validation Testing

- Test capability validation against system capability registry
- Test constraint enforcement during role assignment and usage
- Test metadata schema validation and type safety
- Verify role description parsing and accessibility
- Test version compatibility and migration scenarios

### Service Coordination Integration

- Test data flow between RoleService, FileService, and ValidationService
- Verify proper dependency injection and service initialization
- Test error propagation maintains context across service boundaries
- Validate service method contracts and interface adherence
- Test service lifecycle management and cleanup

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Role Capability and Constraint Validation

- **Given**: Predefined roles with capability and constraint definitions
- **When**: Roles are loaded and validated through service integration
- **Then**: All role attributes are properly parsed, validated, and accessible through service APIs
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Role capabilities are validated against system capability registry during loading
  - Invalid capabilities are rejected with specific validation error messages
  - Role constraints are parsed and available for agent configuration validation
  - Constraint rules are enforced during agent assignment workflows
  - Capability and constraint data types are properly validated and type-safe

### AC-2: Service Coordination and Data Flow

- **Given**: Integrated service layer with RoleService, FileService, and ValidationService
- **When**: Role operations flow through multiple services
- **Then**: Services coordinate correctly with proper error propagation and clean interfaces
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - FileService successfully provides role data to RoleService for processing
  - ValidationService validates role definitions before RoleService accepts them
  - Service dependencies are properly injected and managed throughout operation lifecycle
  - Data contracts between services are maintained and respected
  - Service method calls follow expected patterns and return consistent results

### AC-3: Metadata Accessibility and Query Operations

- **Given**: Successfully loaded roles with complete metadata
- **When**: Role metadata is accessed through various service methods
- **Then**: All role attributes are properly exposed and queryable through consistent APIs
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Role descriptions and metadata are accessible for UI integration and display
  - Role versioning information is preserved and queryable for compatibility checks
  - Metadata queries support filtering by capabilities, constraints, and categories
  - Service APIs provide consistent data formats across different access methods
  - Role metadata updates (for custom roles) maintain data integrity and validation

### AC-4: Error Propagation and Context Preservation

- **Given**: Various error conditions during service coordination
- **When**: Validation errors, file errors, or service failures occur
- **Then**: Error context is maintained across service boundaries with proper debugging information
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Validation errors include specific field names and validation rule violations
  - File system errors preserve file path and operation context
  - Service coordination errors maintain call stack and service boundary information
  - Error messages are user-friendly while preserving technical context for debugging
  - Error recovery and retry mechanisms work correctly across service integrations

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: T-implement-immutability (immutability testing and service setup)
- **External**: ValidationService implementation, service coordination patterns
- **Test Infrastructure**: Jest, metadata validation helpers, service integration mocks

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Setup Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Role Management Predefined Roles Integration", () => {
  let serviceContainer: ServiceContainer;
  let roleService: RoleService;
  let validationService: ValidationService;
  let loadedRoles: Role[];

  beforeEach(async () => {
    serviceContainer = createTestServiceContainer();
    roleService = serviceContainer.get(RoleService);
    validationService = serviceContainer.get(ValidationService);

    loadedRoles = await roleService.loadPredefinedRoles();
  });

  describe("Scenario: Role metadata validation", () => {
    it.skip("should validate capabilities against system requirements", async () => {
      const developerRole = loadedRoles.find((r) => r.id === "role-developer");

      expect(developerRole.capabilities).toContain("coding");
      expect(developerRole.capabilities).toContain("debugging");

      const validationResult = await validationService.validateCapabilities(
        developerRole.capabilities,
      );
      expect(validationResult.isValid).toBe(true);
    });
  });
});
```

### Service Interface Expectations

Define expected interfaces for metadata and coordination:

- `ValidationService.validateCapabilities(capabilities: string[]): Promise<ValidationResult>`
- `ValidationService.validateConstraints(constraints: string[]): Promise<ValidationResult>`
- `RoleService.queryRolesByCapability(capability: string): Promise<Role[]>`
- `RoleService.getRoleMetadata(id: string): Promise<RoleMetadata>`

### Metadata Validation Scenarios

Test comprehensive metadata validation:

- Capability validation against system registry
- Constraint enforcement during role assignment
- Version compatibility checking
- Metadata schema validation and type safety
- Cross-service data consistency

## Metadata Requirements

- Role capabilities must be validated against system capability registry
- Role constraints must be enforceable during agent configuration
- Role descriptions must support internationalization and rich formatting
- Role versioning must support compatibility checking and migration
- Metadata queries must support efficient filtering and search operations

## Performance Requirements

- Metadata validation operations complete within 100ms per role
- Role query operations return results within 50ms for loaded roles
- Service coordination adds minimal overhead (< 10ms) to individual operations
- Memory usage for metadata caching remains efficient during extended operations

## Security Considerations

- Metadata validation prevents malicious capability or constraint definitions
- Service coordination maintains proper access control across service boundaries
- Role metadata queries respect user permissions and role visibility rules
- Validation errors don't expose internal system details or configuration

## Testing Requirements

- Integration tests verify complete metadata validation workflow
- Service coordination tests ensure proper dependency injection and lifecycle management
- Error propagation tests verify context preservation across service boundaries
- Performance tests ensure metadata operations meet speed requirements
- Type safety tests verify proper TypeScript integration and compile-time checking
