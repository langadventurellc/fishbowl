# Implement role loading integration tests with file service coordination

## Context

This task implements comprehensive BDD integration tests for predefined role loading functionality, focusing on the coordination between RoleService and FileService. Tests verify that all 10 predefined roles are correctly loaded from files, parsed, validated, and made available through service APIs.

## Technical Approach

- Create integration test file: `role-predefined-loading.integration.spec.ts`
- Use BDD structure with describe/scenario blocks following Gherkin-style naming
- Test file-based role loading with realistic temporary directories
- Verify service coordination between RoleService, FileService, and ValidationService
- Include comprehensive error handling and edge case testing

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### BDD Test Structure

Create `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/role-management/role-predefined-loading.integration.spec.ts` with:

```typescript
describe("Feature: Role Management Predefined Roles Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Loading predefined roles from files", () => {
    it.skip("should load all 10 predefined roles through file service integration", async () => {
      // Given - Predefined role files in temporary directory
      // When - Loading roles through RoleService and FileService integration
      // Then - All roles are loaded, validated, and accessible
    });
  });

  describe("Scenario: File parsing and validation during role loading", () => {
    it.skip("should parse role metadata correctly from JSON files", async () => {
      // Given - Role files with complete metadata
      // When - Files are parsed through service integration
      // Then - Metadata is accessible and properly typed
    });
  });

  describe("Scenario: Error handling during role loading", () => {
    it.skip("should handle file system errors gracefully", async () => {
      // Given - File system errors or missing files
      // When - Role loading is attempted
      // Then - Appropriate error messages and fallback behavior
    });
  });
});
```

### Service Integration Testing

- Set up temporary directories with predefined role fixtures
- Create RoleService instance with FileService dependency injection
- Test loading workflow: FileService reads → RoleService parses → ValidationService validates
- Verify role data flows correctly through service boundaries
- Test async loading operations and promise resolution

### Comprehensive Role Loading Verification

Test all aspects of role loading:

- All 10 predefined roles are discovered and loaded
- Role metadata (id, name, description, capabilities, constraints) is correctly parsed
- Role versioning and predefined flags are properly set
- Service APIs provide access to loaded roles through consistent interface
- Memory management during loading operations

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Complete Predefined Role Loading

- **Given**: 10 predefined role definition files in temporary directory
- **When**: Roles are loaded through RoleService and FileService integration
- **Then**: All predefined roles are correctly parsed, validated, and available through service APIs
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - All 10 roles (analyst, creative, developer, manager, researcher, strategist, facilitator, critic, innovator, advisor) are loaded successfully
  - Role loading completes within 300ms performance requirement
  - Each role contains complete metadata including capabilities and constraints
  - Role definitions are validated against expected schema during loading
  - Loading operation is idempotent and can be safely repeated

### AC-2: File Service Coordination

- **Given**: FileService and RoleService integration
- **When**: Role loading operations are performed
- **Then**: Services coordinate correctly with proper error propagation and data flow
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - FileService successfully reads role definition files from specified directory
  - File content is passed to RoleService for parsing and processing
  - ValidationService validates role definitions during loading process
  - Service boundaries are respected with clean interfaces and data contracts
  - Error context is maintained across service boundaries for debugging

### AC-3: Role Metadata Accessibility

- **Given**: Successfully loaded predefined roles
- **When**: Role metadata is accessed through service APIs
- **Then**: All role attributes are properly exposed and accessible
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Role capabilities are parsed and available as arrays of strings
  - Role constraints are properly interpreted and enforced
  - Role descriptions and metadata are accessible for UI integration
  - Role versioning information is preserved and queryable
  - isPredefined flag is correctly set for all loaded roles

### AC-4: Error Handling and Resilience

- **Given**: Various error conditions during role loading
- **When**: File system errors, parsing errors, or validation failures occur
- **Then**: Errors are handled gracefully with detailed context and fallback behavior
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Missing role files are detected and reported with specific file names
  - Invalid JSON syntax errors include file path and line number context
  - Validation errors specify which role field failed validation and why
  - Partial loading failures don't prevent other roles from loading successfully
  - Service remains operational and can retry loading operations

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: T-set-up-predefined-role-fixtures (fixtures and test infrastructure)
- **External**: RoleService, FileService, ValidationService interfaces (to be implemented)
- **Test Infrastructure**: Jest, temporary directory helpers, mock factories

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Setup Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Role Management Predefined Roles Integration", () => {
  let tempDir: string;
  let roleService: RoleService;
  let fileService: FileService;
  let validationService: ValidationService;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    tempDir = await createTemporaryDirectory();
    await copyRoleFixturesToDirectory(tempDir);

    fileService = new FileService(tempDir);
    validationService = new ValidationService();
    roleService = new RoleService(fileService, validationService);
  });

  afterEach(async () => {
    await cleanupTemporaryDirectory(tempDir);
  });
});
```

### Service Interface Expectations

Define expected interfaces for service coordination:

- `FileService.readRoleDefinitions(directory: string): Promise<RoleDefinition[]>`
- `ValidationService.validateRole(role: RoleDefinition): ValidationResult`
- `RoleService.loadPredefinedRoles(): Promise<Role[]>`
- `RoleService.getRoleById(id: string): Role | null`

## Files to Create/Modify

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/role-management/
└── role-predefined-loading.integration.spec.ts

packages/shared/src/services/ (interfaces for service coordination)
├── RoleService.ts
├── FileService.ts
└── ValidationService.ts
```

## Performance Requirements

- Role loading operations complete within 300ms for all 10 roles
- Individual role access through service APIs completes within 50ms
- Memory usage remains stable during repeated loading operations
- No memory leaks during file reading and parsing operations

## Security Considerations

- Role definition files are validated for malicious content before parsing
- File system operations are restricted to designated role definition directories
- Role loading respects file system permissions and access controls
- Service interfaces validate input parameters to prevent injection attacks

## Testing Requirements

- Integration tests verify complete loading workflow from file system to service APIs
- Error condition tests cover file system failures, parsing errors, and validation failures
- Performance tests ensure loading operations meet speed requirements
- Memory tests verify no leaks during repeated loading operations
- Service boundary tests verify proper interface adherence and data contracts
