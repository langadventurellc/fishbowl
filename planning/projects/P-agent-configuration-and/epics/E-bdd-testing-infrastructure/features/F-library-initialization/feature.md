# Library Initialization Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for library initialization workflows, focusing on component startup coordination, dependency resolution, and library configuration loading. These tests verify the library initializes correctly with all components properly configured and ready for operation.

## Key Components to Implement

- **Component Initialization Coordination**: Test startup sequence coordination across all library components
- **Dependency Resolution**: Verify component dependencies are resolved correctly during initialization
- **Configuration Loading Integration**: Test library configuration loading and component configuration
- **Initialization Error Handling**: Ensure initialization failures are handled gracefully with proper cleanup

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Component Startup Coordination

- **Given**: Library initialization requiring coordination across all components
- **When**: Library initialization is performed through startup workflows
- **Then**: All components initialize in correct order with proper dependency satisfaction
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Component initialization follows dependency order (FileService → ValidationService → PersonalityService → RoleService → AgentService → ConfigurationService)
  - Initialization failures in one component trigger appropriate cleanup in dependent components
  - Component startup coordination completes within acceptable time limits
  - Initialization state is properly tracked and accessible for debugging

### AC-2: Library Configuration Integration

- **Given**: Library requiring configuration loading during initialization
- **When**: Configuration is loaded and applied to components during startup
- **Then**: All components receive and apply configuration correctly
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Library configuration is loaded from appropriate sources (files, environment, defaults)
  - Component-specific configuration is properly distributed during initialization
  - Configuration validation is performed before component initialization
  - Configuration errors prevent library initialization with clear error messages

### AC-3: Initialization Error Handling and Recovery

- **Given**: Library initialization scenarios with potential failure points
- **When**: Initialization failures occur in various components
- **Then**: Failures are handled gracefully with proper cleanup and recovery mechanisms
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Component initialization failures trigger appropriate rollback of dependent components
  - Initialization errors provide clear diagnostic information for troubleshooting
  - Partial initialization states are cleaned up properly to prevent resource leaks
  - Recovery mechanisms allow retry of initialization after addressing failures

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Library Initialization Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Complete library initialization with all components", () => {
    it.skip("should initialize all components in dependency order with configuration", async () => {
      // Given - Library requiring complete initialization with configuration
      // When - Performing library initialization through startup workflow
      // Then - All components initialize successfully with proper configuration
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Initialization Sequence Testing**: Test component initialization order and dependency resolution
- **Configuration Integration**: Focus on configuration loading and distribution during initialization
- **Error Recovery Testing**: Test initialization failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- **State Management**: Verify initialization state tracking and component readiness validation

### Testing Requirements

#### Initialization Coverage

- ✅ Component initialization coordination with dependency order enforcement
- ✅ Library configuration loading and distribution to components
- ✅ Initialization error handling with proper cleanup and rollback
- ✅ Component readiness validation and state tracking
- ✅ Initialization performance optimization and timeout handling
- ✅ Recovery mechanisms for initialization retry scenarios

#### Integration Validation

- ✅ FileService initialization provides foundation for other components
- ✅ ValidationService initialization enables component validation workflows
- ✅ PersonalityService and RoleService initialization with template loading
- ✅ AgentService and ConfigurationService initialization with cross-component coordination

## Security Considerations

- **Initialization Security**: Library initialization validates security configuration and access controls
- **Configuration Security**: Configuration loading includes security validation and sanitization
- **Component Security**: Component initialization establishes secure communication channels
- **State Protection**: Initialization state is protected from unauthorized access and modification

## Performance Requirements

- **Initialization Speed**: Complete library initialization completes within 2000ms
- **Component Startup**: Individual component initialization completes within 500ms
- **Configuration Loading**: Configuration loading and validation completes within 300ms
- **Memory Efficiency**: Initialization minimizes memory usage and prevents resource leaks

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-library-component-interaction (component coordination foundation)
- **External**: All library components and LibraryInitializationService
- **Test Infrastructure**: Initialization mock coordination, configuration fixtures, startup scenario builders
