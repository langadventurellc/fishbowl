# Reference Error Handling Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for reference error handling across service boundaries, focusing on invalid reference detection, reference resolution failures, and cross-service reference integrity. These tests verify reference errors are handled consistently with proper error context and recovery mechanisms.

## Key Components to Implement

- **Invalid Reference Detection**: Test detection of invalid personality, role, and model references across services
- **Reference Resolution Error Handling**: Verify reference resolution failures are handled gracefully
- **Cross-Service Reference Error Propagation**: Test reference error propagation maintains context across services
- **Reference Error Recovery**: Ensure reference errors allow for proper correction and retry workflows

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Invalid Reference Detection Integration

- **Given**: Agent configurations with invalid personality, role, or model references
- **When**: Reference validation is performed through cross-service integration
- **Then**: Invalid references are detected with comprehensive error information
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Invalid personality references are detected during agent configuration workflows
  - Invalid role references trigger specific error messages with available role suggestions
  - Model reference validation includes checking model availability and compatibility
  - Reference validation errors include specific reference identifiers and service context

### AC-2: Reference Resolution Error Handling

- **Given**: Reference resolution failures during cross-service operations
- **When**: Reference resolution errors occur during integration workflows
- **Then**: Resolution failures are handled gracefully with appropriate fallback mechanisms
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Reference resolution timeouts are handled with appropriate error messages
  - Service communication failures during reference resolution trigger retry mechanisms
  - Partial reference resolution failures provide detailed information about successful and failed references
  - Resolution error recovery maintains operation state for correction workflows

### AC-3: Cross-Service Reference Error Context

- **Given**: Reference errors occurring across multiple service boundaries
- **When**: Reference errors are propagated through service integration workflows
- **Then**: Error context is preserved and enhanced across service boundaries
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Reference errors maintain context about originating service and operation
  - Error propagation includes reference chain information for nested references
  - Cross-service reference errors provide guidance for resolution across affected services
  - Reference error aggregation provides complete picture of all reference failures

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Reference Error Handling Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Invalid personality reference in agent configuration", () => {
    it.skip("should detect invalid reference and provide resolution guidance", async () => {
      // Given - Agent configuration with invalid personality reference
      // When - Validating configuration through cross-service reference checking
      // Then - Invalid reference is detected with actionable error information
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Reference Validation Testing**: Test reference validation across PersonalityService, RoleService, and ModelService
- **Error Context Testing**: Focus on reference error context preservation during cross-service operations
- **Resolution Failure Testing**: Test reference resolution failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- **Cross-Service Error Testing**: Verify reference errors propagate correctly across service boundaries

### Testing Requirements

#### Reference Error Coverage

- ✅ Invalid personality reference detection with specific error guidance
- ✅ Invalid role reference detection with available role suggestions
- ✅ Model reference validation with compatibility and availability checking
- ✅ Reference resolution timeout and failure handling
- ✅ Cross-service reference error propagation with context preservation
- ✅ Reference error recovery workflows with correction mechanisms

#### Integration Error Validation

- ✅ PersonalityService reference errors integrate with AgentService validation
- ✅ RoleService reference errors maintain context during agent configuration
- ✅ ModelService reference errors provide compatibility guidance
- ✅ Reference resolution service coordination handles error scenarios appropriately

## Security Considerations

- **Reference Security**: Reference error messages don't expose unauthorized resource information
- **Access Control Errors**: Reference access errors respect security policies and permissions
- **Error Context Security**: Reference error context doesn't reveal sensitive system information
- **Recovery Security**: Reference error recovery maintains security constraints

## Performance Requirements

- **Reference Validation Speed**: Reference error detection adds minimal overhead to validation
- **Error Context Performance**: Reference error context preservation doesn't impact performance significantly
- **Resolution Error Performance**: Reference resolution error handling completes within acceptable time
- **Recovery Performance**: Reference error recovery workflows complete efficiently

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-agent-configuration-references (reference management), F-validation-error-handling (error handling foundation)
- **External**: ReferenceService, PersonalityService, RoleService, ModelService, ErrorHandlingService
- **Test Infrastructure**: Reference error builders, invalid reference fixtures, resolution failure mocks
