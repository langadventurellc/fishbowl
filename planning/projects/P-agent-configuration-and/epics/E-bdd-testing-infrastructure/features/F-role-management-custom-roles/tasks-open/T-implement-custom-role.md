# Custom Role Capabilities Integration Tests

Create comprehensive BDD integration tests for custom role capability definition, validation, and constraint enforcement through service layer integration. Focus on capability validation services and integration with authorization systems.

## Context and References

- **Parent Feature**: F-role-management-custom-roles (Role Management Custom Roles Integration Tests)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: AC-2 Custom Role Capability Integration
- **Related Patterns**: Follow BDD structure from existing role management integration tests
- **Service Dependencies**: ValidationService, CapabilityService, AuthorizationService

## Implementation Requirements

### File Location

Create: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/role-management/role-custom-capabilities.integration.spec.ts`

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe("Feature: Custom Role Capabilities Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Validating custom capabilities against system constraints", () => {
    it.skip("should validate custom capabilities through validation service integration", async () => {
      // Given - Custom capabilities and system constraint definitions
      // When - Validating through CapabilityService and ValidationService
      // Then - Capabilities validated against system requirements and business rules
    });
  });
});
```

### Capability Validation Coverage

#### Custom Capability Definition

- **Scenario**: Defining user-created capabilities with technical validation
- **Given**: Custom capability definitions with specific permissions and constraints
- **When**: CapabilityService.defineCustomCapability() processes definitions
- **Then**: Capabilities validated for technical feasibility and system compatibility

#### Capability Constraint Enforcement

- **Scenario**: Enforcing role constraints during agent configuration
- **Given**: Custom roles with defined capability constraints
- **When**: Role constraints processed during agent configuration workflows
- **Then**: Constraint enforcement prevents invalid configurations and maintains system integrity

#### Authorization Integration

- **Scenario**: Integrating custom role permissions with authorization services
- **Given**: Custom roles with permission definitions and capability mappings
- **When**: AuthorizationService processes custom role permissions
- **Then**: Custom permissions integrate correctly with system authorization workflows

#### Conflict Detection

- **Scenario**: Detecting capability conflicts with system requirements
- **Given**: Custom capabilities that may conflict with system constraints
- **When**: ValidationService.validateCapabilityConflicts() checks for conflicts
- **Then**: Conflicts detected and reported with clear context and resolution guidance

## Technical Approach

### Service Integration Pattern

- Mock CapabilityService for capability definition and validation
- Mock ValidationService for business rule enforcement and conflict detection
- Mock AuthorizationService for permission integration testing
- Setup capability fixture data for various validation scenarios

### Capability Validation Logic

```typescript
// Test capability validation workflows
const capability = {
  id: "custom-data-analysis",
  permissions: ["read-data", "analyze-patterns"],
  constraints: ["no-external-api-access", "audit-required"],
  systemRequirements: ["memory-intensive", "processing-power"],
};

// Validate through service integration
await capabilityService.validateCustomCapability(capability);
```

### Performance Requirements

- **Capability validation**: Complete within 200ms per capability
- **Constraint checking**: Complete within 100ms per constraint
- **Authorization integration**: Complete within 150ms per permission check
- **Conflict detection**: Complete within 300ms for complex validation scenarios

## Security Considerations

### Capability Boundary Validation

- Test custom capabilities cannot exceed system security boundaries
- Verify capability permissions don't grant unauthorized access
- Validate constraint definitions prevent privilege escalation
- Test capability isolation between different custom roles

### Authorization Integration Security

- Test custom role permissions integrate securely with authorization system
- Verify capability-based access control works correctly
- Validate permission inheritance and restriction patterns
- Test audit logging for capability-based operations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Capability Validation

- ✅ Custom capabilities validated for technical feasibility and system compatibility
- ✅ Capability definitions checked against system constraints and requirements
- ✅ Invalid capabilities rejected with clear error messages and guidance
- ✅ Capability validation integrates with role creation and modification workflows

### Constraint Enforcement

- ✅ Role constraints enforced during agent configuration workflows
- ✅ Constraint violations prevented with appropriate error handling
- ✅ Constraint inheritance and override patterns work correctly
- ✅ Agent configuration respects custom role capability boundaries

### Authorization Integration

- ✅ Custom role permissions integrate correctly with authorization services
- ✅ Capability-based access control functions as expected
- ✅ Permission conflicts detected and resolved appropriately
- ✅ Authorization decisions respect custom role capability definitions

### Conflict Detection

- ✅ Capability conflicts with system requirements detected accurately
- ✅ Conflict resolution guidance provided with clear context
- ✅ Multiple conflict scenarios handled gracefully
- ✅ Conflict detection performance meets specified requirements

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Capability fixture data with various validation scenarios
- Mock service factories for CapabilityService and ValidationService
- Authorization service mock for permission integration testing
- Test data builders for complex capability definition scenarios

## Testing Strategy

- Include unit tests for capability validation logic within implementation
- Focus on service integration and workflow validation
- Test edge cases and error conditions thoroughly
- Validate security boundaries and authorization integration
