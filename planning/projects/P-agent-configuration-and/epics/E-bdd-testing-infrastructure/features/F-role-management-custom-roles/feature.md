# Role Management Custom Roles Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for custom role CRUD operations, focusing on user-created roles with full lifecycle management. These tests verify custom role service integration with persistence layers, validation services, and ensure custom roles can be created, modified, and deleted while maintaining system integrity.

## Key Components to Implement

- **Custom Role CRUD Operations**: Test complete lifecycle management through service integration
- **Role Capability Definition**: Verify custom capability definitions integrate with validation services
- **Custom Role Validation**: Test business rule enforcement for custom role creation and modification
- **Template-Based Creation**: Verify custom roles can be derived from predefined role templates

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Custom Role CRUD Integration

- **Given**: Role management system with custom role capabilities
- **When**: CRUD operations are performed on custom roles through service layer
- **Then**: All operations integrate correctly with persistence and validation services
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Create operations validate custom role data and persist to storage
  - Read operations retrieve complete custom role data with metadata
  - Update operations preserve data integrity and validate changes
  - Delete operations handle dependencies and clean up related resources

### AC-2: Custom Role Capability Integration

- **Given**: Custom roles with user-defined capabilities and constraints
- **When**: Role capabilities are processed through validation services
- **Then**: Capability definitions are validated against system requirements and business rules
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Custom capabilities are validated for technical feasibility
  - Role constraints are enforced during agent configuration workflows
  - Capability conflicts with system requirements are detected and reported
  - Custom role permissions integrate with authorization services

### AC-3: Template-Based Custom Role Creation

- **Given**: Predefined roles available as templates for custom role creation
- **When**: Custom roles are created using predefined templates as starting points
- **Then**: Template data is properly copied and customized while maintaining template references
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Template-based creation copies all relevant role attributes
  - Custom modifications don't affect original predefined templates
  - Template references are maintained for tracking and updates
  - Template version compatibility is validated during creation

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Role Management Custom Roles Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Creating custom role from template", () => {
    it.skip("should create custom role using predefined template through service integration", async () => {
      // Given - Predefined role template and custom modifications
      // When - Creating custom role through RoleService integration
      // Then - Custom role is created with template reference and modifications
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Service Layer Integration**: Test RoleService, PersistenceService, and ValidationService coordination
- **Template Integration**: Test custom role creation from predefined role templates
- **Capability Validation**: Focus on custom capability definition and validation workflows
- **Lifecycle Management**: Test complete custom role lifecycle from creation to deletion

### Testing Requirements

#### Custom Role CRUD Coverage

- ✅ Custom role creation with complete validation and persistence
- ✅ Custom role reading with proper data retrieval and transformation
- ✅ Custom role updates with change validation and version management
- ✅ Custom role deletion with dependency checking and cleanup
- ✅ Template-based custom role creation with reference tracking
- ✅ Custom role capability definition and validation

#### Integration Validation

- ✅ Custom role operations integrate with persistence layer correctly
- ✅ Role validation services process custom role data appropriately
- ✅ Custom role capabilities are validated against system constraints
- ✅ Template references are maintained and updated correctly

## Security Considerations

- **Role Permission Validation**: Custom role capabilities are validated for security implications
- **Access Control**: Custom role operations respect user permissions and authorization
- **Capability Constraints**: Custom capabilities cannot exceed system security boundaries
- **Audit Logging**: Custom role operations are logged for security monitoring and compliance

## Performance Requirements

- **CRUD Performance**: Custom role operations complete within 500ms under normal load
- **Validation Speed**: Custom role validation completes within 200ms per role
- **Template Operations**: Template-based creation completes within 300ms
- **Search Efficiency**: Custom role queries with filtering complete within 100ms

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-role-management-predefined-roles (template functionality and role system foundation)
- **External**: RoleService, PersistenceService, ValidationService, TemplateService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Role builders, custom role fixtures, template data builders
