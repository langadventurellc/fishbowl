# Custom Role Validation Integration Tests

Create comprehensive BDD integration tests for custom role validation focusing on business rule enforcement, data integrity validation, and integration with validation services during custom role lifecycle operations.

## Context and References

- **Parent Feature**: F-role-management-custom-roles (Role Management Custom Roles Integration Tests)
- **Related Patterns**: Follow validation patterns from existing role management tests
- **Service Integration**: ValidationService, RoleService, BusinessRuleEngine
- **Validation Types**: Schema validation, business rule validation, constraint validation

## Implementation Requirements

### File Location

Create: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/role-management/role-custom-validation.integration.spec.ts`

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe("Feature: Custom Role Validation Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Validating custom role business rules", () => {
    it.skip("should validate custom role against business rules through service integration", async () => {
      // Given - Custom role data with various business rule scenarios
      // When - ValidationService processes role through business rule engine
      // Then - Business rules enforced and validation results provided appropriately
    });
  });
});
```

### Validation Coverage Areas

#### Schema Validation Integration

- **Scenario**: Validating custom role data structure and types
- **Given**: Custom role data with various schema compliance scenarios
- **When**: ValidationService.validateRoleSchema() processes role definitions
- **Then**: Schema validation enforces required fields, data types, and structural integrity

#### Business Rule Enforcement

- **Scenario**: Enforcing business rules during custom role operations
- **Given**: Custom roles with capabilities and constraints that must follow business rules
- **When**: BusinessRuleEngine.validateCustomRole() processes role business logic
- **Then**: Business rules enforced for role consistency, capability conflicts, and system requirements

#### Constraint Validation

- **Scenario**: Validating custom role constraints and capability limits
- **Given**: Custom roles with constraint definitions and capability boundaries
- **When**: ConstraintValidator.validateRoleConstraints() checks constraint compliance
- **Then**: Constraint validation ensures role capabilities remain within defined boundaries

#### Cross-Role Validation

- **Scenario**: Validating custom roles against existing role ecosystem
- **Given**: Multiple custom roles with potential conflicts or overlaps
- **When**: ValidationService.validateRoleEcosystem() checks role relationships
- **Then**: Role ecosystem validation prevents conflicts and maintains system coherence

## Technical Approach

### Validation Service Integration

```typescript
// Comprehensive validation workflow
const customRole = {
  id: "custom-financial-analyst",
  name: "Financial Data Analyst",
  capabilities: [
    "financial-analysis",
    "data-visualization",
    "report-generation",
  ],
  constraints: ["no-external-api", "audit-logging-required"],
  businessRules: ["senior-approval-required", "data-sensitivity-high"],
};

// Multi-layer validation
await validationService.validateRoleSchema(customRole);
await businessRuleEngine.validateCustomRole(customRole);
await constraintValidator.validateRoleConstraints(customRole);
```

### Validation Error Handling

- Collect validation errors from multiple validation layers
- Provide detailed error context with field-specific guidance
- Support partial validation for incremental role building
- Generate validation reports with actionable feedback

### Business Rule Categories

- **Capability Rules**: Validate capability combinations and conflicts
- **Constraint Rules**: Ensure constraints are feasible and enforceable
- **Security Rules**: Validate role security boundaries and permissions
- **Performance Rules**: Check role complexity and resource requirements

### Performance Requirements

- **Schema validation**: Complete within 100ms per role
- **Business rule validation**: Complete within 200ms per role
- **Constraint validation**: Complete within 150ms per role
- **Cross-role validation**: Complete within 500ms for ecosystem checks

## Security Considerations

### Validation Security

- Ensure validation processes don't expose sensitive system information
- Validate that custom roles can't bypass security constraints
- Test validation service isolation and secure error reporting
- Verify validation doesn't create security vulnerabilities

### Business Rule Security

- Test business rules prevent privilege escalation through custom roles
- Validate security-critical business rules cannot be bypassed
- Ensure business rule evaluation respects authorization boundaries
- Test audit logging for business rule violations and enforcement

## Acceptance Criteria

### Schema Validation

- ✅ Custom role schema validation enforces required fields and data types
- ✅ Schema violations detected and reported with specific field context
- ✅ Schema validation integrates correctly with role creation and modification workflows
- ✅ Validation performance meets specified requirements for schema checks

### Business Rule Enforcement

- ✅ Business rules enforced consistently during custom role operations
- ✅ Business rule violations prevented with clear error messages and guidance
- ✅ Complex business rule scenarios handled correctly
- ✅ Business rule validation integrates with role lifecycle management

### Constraint Validation

- ✅ Role constraints validated for feasibility and enforceability
- ✅ Constraint violations detected before role creation or modification
- ✅ Constraint validation respects system capabilities and limitations
- ✅ Constraint error messages provide actionable guidance for resolution

### Cross-Role Validation

- ✅ Role ecosystem validation detects conflicts between custom roles
- ✅ Role overlap scenarios identified and managed appropriately
- ✅ System coherence maintained through role relationship validation
- ✅ Cross-role validation performance meets efficiency requirements

### Error Handling and Reporting

- ✅ Validation errors provide comprehensive context and resolution guidance
- ✅ Multiple validation failures collected and reported together
- ✅ Validation error severity levels appropriately categorized
- ✅ Error reporting integrates with user interface and API responses

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- ValidationService mock with comprehensive validation capabilities
- BusinessRuleEngine mock for business logic enforcement
- ConstraintValidator mock for constraint checking
- Custom role fixture data with various validation scenarios
- Test data builders for invalid role scenarios

## Testing Strategy

- Test positive validation scenarios for properly formed custom roles
- Include comprehensive negative testing for validation failures
- Test validation integration across multiple service boundaries
- Focus on business rule enforcement and constraint validation
- Validate error handling and reporting mechanisms thoroughly
- Include unit tests for validation logic within implementation tasks

### Log

**2025-07-27T17:27:57.243437Z** - Successfully implemented comprehensive BDD integration tests for custom role validation with business rule enforcement, covering schema validation, business rule enforcement, constraint validation, cross-role validation, error handling, performance requirements, and security considerations. All tests follow established BDD patterns and are initially skipped for progressive implementation.
