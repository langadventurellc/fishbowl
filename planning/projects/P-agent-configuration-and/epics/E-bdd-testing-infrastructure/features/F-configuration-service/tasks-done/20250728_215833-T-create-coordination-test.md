# Create Coordination Test Fixtures and Infrastructure

## Context and Purpose

Create comprehensive test fixtures and infrastructure to support complex multi-service workflow orchestration tests for Configuration Service coordination. This task establishes the foundation for testing workflows that coordinate PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, and FileService.

## Detailed Requirements

### Test Fixtures Development

- **Multi-Service Workflow Scenarios**: Create JSON fixture files with complex workflow definitions coordinating multiple services
- **Communication Pattern Examples**: Create fixture data representing different inter-service communication patterns with success and failure scenarios
- **System Consistency Scenarios**: Create test data representing configuration changes that affect multiple services and require consistency validation

### Infrastructure Components

- **Service Coordination Mocks**: Extend existing mock factories to support complex multi-service orchestration scenarios
- **Workflow State Management**: Create utilities for managing and tracking workflow state across service interactions
- **Performance Testing Support**: Create helpers for measuring coordination performance across service boundaries

## Technical Approach

### File Structure to Create

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/fixtures/
├── service-coordination/
│   ├── multi-service-workflows.json
│   ├── communication-patterns.json
│   └── consistency-scenarios.json
```

### Key Components to Implement

1. **Multi-Service Workflow Fixtures** (`multi-service-workflows.json`):
   - Complex workflows requiring PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService coordination
   - FileService integration scenarios for configuration persistence
   - Workflow state transitions and validation checkpoints
   - Error scenarios and compensation workflows

2. **Communication Pattern Fixtures** (`communication-patterns.json`):
   - Request/response patterns between services with realistic payloads
   - Error propagation scenarios with context preservation
   - Retry and circuit breaker pattern test data
   - Service timeout and failure simulation scenarios

3. **System Consistency Fixtures** (`consistency-scenarios.json`):
   - Configuration changes affecting multiple services
   - Conflict resolution test cases
   - Eventual consistency validation scenarios
   - Cross-service dependency validation data

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ Multi-service workflow fixtures support complex orchestration scenarios
- ✅ Communication pattern fixtures cover success, failure, and retry scenarios
- ✅ System consistency fixtures validate cross-service configuration changes
- ✅ Mock factory extensions support realistic multi-service interactions
- ✅ Performance testing infrastructure measures coordination overhead accurately

### Integration Validation

- ✅ Fixtures integrate seamlessly with existing ConfigurationServiceMockFactory patterns
- ✅ Mock extensions maintain compatibility with individual service mock factories
- ✅ Infrastructure supports both unit and integration testing approaches
- ✅ Performance helpers provide consistent measurement across different test scenarios

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: Existing mock factory infrastructure, ConfigurationServiceMockFactory, service type definitions
- **External**: PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, FileService interface definitions
- **Test Infrastructure**: EnhancedTemporaryDirectoryManager, existing fixture patterns

## Security Considerations

- **Test Data Isolation**: Ensure fixture data doesn't contain production-like sensitive information
- **Mock Service Security**: Validate that mock services maintain proper authorization patterns
- **State Management Security**: Ensure workflow state tracking doesn't leak sensitive configuration data

## Performance Requirements

- **Fixture Loading Performance**: Fixture files load within 100ms for efficient test execution
- **Mock Service Performance**: Mock factories create service instances within 50ms
- **Coordination Overhead**: Infrastructure adds minimal overhead (<10ms) to test execution

## Testing Requirements

Since we're in the BDD red phase, this task should create test shells only using `it.skip()`. Create basic structure and infrastructure validation tests to ensure fixtures and mocks are properly configured and accessible to the main test files.

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing fixture patterns established in the codebase
- Ensure compatibility with Jest testing framework and existing BDD structure
- Create realistic but focused test data that covers edge cases without excessive complexity
- Use TypeScript for type safety in fixture definitions and mock extensions

### Log

**2025-07-29T02:58:33.842842Z** - Successfully implemented comprehensive coordination test fixtures and infrastructure for multi-service workflow orchestration. Created JSON fixtures for workflow scenarios, communication patterns, and consistency validation. Enhanced ConfigurationServiceMockFactory with workflow coordination capabilities including state tracking, circuit breaker simulation, and compensation workflows. Developed WorkflowCoordinationHelpers with fluent builder APIs for creating complex test scenarios. All infrastructure maintains backward compatibility and passes quality checks (lint, format, type-check).
