# Implement Multi-Service Orchestration Integration Tests

## Context and Purpose

Create comprehensive BDD integration tests for complex multi-service workflow orchestration through ConfigurationService. This implements the "Multi-Service Workflow Orchestration" acceptance criteria from the feature specification, testing coordination across PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, and FileService.

## Detailed Requirements

### Test File Implementation

Create `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-multi-service-orchestration.integration.spec.ts` with comprehensive test scenarios covering:

### Core Test Scenarios

#### AC-1: Multi-Service Workflow Orchestration

- **Complex Workflow Steps**: Test workflows coordinating PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, and FileService
- **Workflow State Consistency**: Verify workflow state remains consistent across all service interactions
- **Compensation and Rollback**: Test workflow failures trigger appropriate compensation across services
- **Performance Thresholds**: Ensure complex workflows complete within 2000ms requirement

## Technical Approach

### BDD Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Configuration Multi-Service Orchestration Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Complex multi-service workflow orchestration", () => {
    it.skip("should orchestrate workflow across all services with state consistency", async () => {
      // Given - Complex workflow requiring multiple service coordination
      // When - Executing workflow through ConfigurationService orchestration
      // Then - All services coordinate with proper state management and error handling
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

#### Multi-Service Workflow Scenarios

1. **Complete Agent Creation Workflow**:
   - PersonalityService validates personality configuration
   - RoleService validates and provides role capabilities
   - AgentService creates agent with validated dependencies
   - FileService persists configuration with proper metadata
   - Test workflow state transitions and consistency validation

2. **Complex Configuration Update Workflow**:
   - ConfigurationService coordinates updates across multiple services
   - PersonalityService handles personality trait modifications
   - RoleService updates role assignments and capabilities
   - AgentService reflects changes in agent configurations
   - FileService maintains version history and backup consistency

3. **Cross-Service Dependency Resolution**:
   - Test workflows requiring dependency resolution across services
   - Validate service orchestration maintains dependency constraints
   - Ensure workflow completion despite service interaction complexity

#### Error Handling and Compensation

1. **Partial Workflow Failure Recovery**:
   - Test workflows where individual services fail during orchestration
   - Validate compensation mechanisms rollback changes across services
   - Ensure system returns to consistent state after failure recovery

2. **Service Communication Failures**:
   - Test orchestration behavior when service communication fails
   - Validate retry mechanisms and timeout handling
   - Ensure workflow state consistency despite communication issues

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ Complex workflows coordinate PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, and FileService effectively
- ✅ Workflow state management maintains consistency across all service interactions
- ✅ Workflow failure scenarios trigger proper compensation and rollback mechanisms
- ✅ Complex workflows complete within 2000ms performance threshold
- ✅ Service orchestration patterns optimize for both reliability and performance

### Integration Validation

- ✅ ConfigurationService orchestrates all dependent services seamlessly
- ✅ Multi-service workflows maintain data integrity throughout execution
- ✅ Error propagation preserves context across complex service interactions
- ✅ Workflow state tracking provides visibility into orchestration progress
- ✅ Performance measurement validates orchestration efficiency

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: T-create-coordination-test (fixtures and infrastructure), existing service mock factories
- **External**: ConfigurationService, PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, FileService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Multi-service workflow fixtures, coordination mock extensions

## Security Considerations

- **Workflow Security Context**: Multi-service workflows maintain security context across all interactions
- **Service Authentication**: Inter-service communication uses secure authentication protocols
- **State Security**: Workflow state tracking protects sensitive configuration data
- **Audit Trail**: Complex workflows generate comprehensive audit logs for security compliance

## Performance Requirements

- **Workflow Completion**: Complex multi-service workflows complete within 2000ms
- **Service Coordination**: Individual service interactions complete within 500ms
- **State Management**: Workflow state operations add minimal overhead (<50ms)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Orchestration patterns use memory efficiently for large workflows

## Testing Requirements

Since we're in the BDD red phase, implement all test scenarios using `it.skip()`. Focus on creating comprehensive test shells that:

- Define complete Given-When-Then scenarios for each workflow type
- Include detailed test descriptions explaining orchestration requirements
- Set up proper test data and mock service configurations
- Validate expected outcomes and performance requirements
- Handle error scenarios and compensation workflows

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing BDD test patterns established in the codebase
- Use realistic workflow scenarios that demonstrate practical system usage
- Include comprehensive error scenarios to validate system resilience
- Implement performance measurement for all workflow scenarios
- Ensure test maintainability through clear scenario organization

### Log

**2025-07-29T03:10:48.768155Z** - Implemented comprehensive multi-service orchestration integration tests for complex workflow coordination using BDD patterns with it.skip() statements.

Created complete test file with 8 comprehensive test scenarios covering:

- AC-1: Multi-Service Workflow Orchestration (2 scenarios)
- Workflow failure handling and compensation (2 scenarios)
- AC-2: Service Communication Integration (2 scenarios)
- AC-3: System-Wide Configuration Consistency (3 scenarios)

All tests follow proper BDD structure with Feature/Scenario/Given-When-Then organization and include detailed comments for future implementation. Tests are properly skipped with it.skip() and include comprehensive acceptance criteria coverage for PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, and FileService coordination through ConfigurationService orchestration.

Test infrastructure includes circuit breaker patterns, retry mechanisms, compensation workflows, consistency validation, and conflict resolution scenarios. All scenarios include performance requirements and error handling patterns as specified in the feature requirements.
