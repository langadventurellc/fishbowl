# Configuration Service Coordination Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for configuration service coordination workflows, focusing on complex multi-service orchestration, workflow management, and system-wide configuration consistency. These tests verify ConfigurationService coordinates effectively across all system services while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Related Functional Work

This feature tests the functionality defined in:

- **[E-configuration-management](../../../E-configuration-management/epic.md)**: ConfigurationService cross-service coordination, workflow orchestration mechanisms, and system-wide configuration consistency management

## Key Components to Implement

- **Multi-Service Orchestration**: Test complex workflows coordinating PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, and FileService
- **Workflow State Management**: Verify workflow state consistency across service interactions
- **Service Communication Patterns**: Test communication patterns and error propagation across services
- **System-Wide Configuration Consistency**: Ensure configuration changes maintain system-wide consistency

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Multi-Service Workflow Orchestration

- **Given**: Complex configuration workflows requiring coordination across multiple services
- **When**: Workflows are orchestrated through ConfigurationService
- **Then**: All services coordinate effectively with proper workflow state management
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Workflow steps coordinate across PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, and FileService
  - Service orchestration maintains workflow state consistency
  - Workflow failures trigger appropriate compensation and rollback across services
  - Complex workflows complete within acceptable performance thresholds

### AC-2: Service Communication Integration

- **Given**: Configuration operations requiring inter-service communication
- **When**: Services communicate through ConfigurationService coordination
- **Then**: Communication patterns maintain reliability and performance across service boundaries
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Service communication errors are handled gracefully with retry mechanisms
  - Communication patterns optimize for performance while maintaining reliability
  - Message passing between services maintains data integrity and consistency
  - Service coordination includes circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance

### AC-3: System-Wide Configuration Consistency

- **Given**: Configuration changes affecting multiple services and components
- **When**: Changes are propagated through ConfigurationService coordination
- **Then**: System-wide consistency is maintained with eventual consistency guarantees
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Configuration changes propagate correctly across all affected services
  - Consistency verification includes validation across service boundaries
  - Conflict resolution mechanisms handle concurrent configuration changes
  - System state remains consistent even during partial service failures

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Configuration Service Coordination Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Complex multi-service workflow orchestration", () => {
    it.skip("should orchestrate workflow across all services with state consistency", async () => {
      // Given - Complex workflow requiring multiple service coordination
      // When - Executing workflow through ConfigurationService orchestration
      // Then - All services coordinate with proper state management and error handling
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Workflow Testing**: Test complex multi-step workflows across service boundaries
- **Orchestration Pattern Testing**: Focus on service orchestration patterns and state management
- **Communication Pattern Validation**: Test inter-service communication reliability and performance
- **Consistency Verification**: Verify system-wide consistency mechanisms and conflict resolution

### Testing Requirements

#### Coordination Coverage

- ✅ Multi-service workflow orchestration with state management
- ✅ Service communication patterns with error handling and retry mechanisms
- ✅ System-wide configuration consistency with conflict resolution
- ✅ Workflow compensation and rollback across multiple services
- ✅ Performance optimization for complex coordination scenarios
- ✅ Fault tolerance with circuit breaker and fallback patterns

#### Integration Validation

- ✅ ConfigurationService orchestrates PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService coordination
- ✅ FileService integration maintains consistency during complex workflows
- ✅ Validation services coordinate properly during multi-service operations
- ✅ Error propagation maintains context across complex service interactions

## Security Considerations

- **Workflow Security**: Multi-service workflows maintain security context across all interactions
- **Communication Security**: Inter-service communication uses secure protocols and authentication
- **State Protection**: Workflow state is protected from unauthorized access and modification
- **Audit Coordination**: Complex workflows are logged comprehensively for security auditing

## Performance Requirements

- **Workflow Performance**: Complex multi-service workflows complete within 2000ms
- **Communication Efficiency**: Inter-service communication minimizes latency and overhead
- **State Management Overhead**: Workflow state management adds minimal performance impact
- **Scalability**: Coordination patterns scale effectively with increased service load

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-configuration-service-crud (CRUD foundation), F-configuration-service-file (file operations foundation)
- **External**: ConfigurationService, PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, FileService, WorkflowService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Multi-service orchestration mocks, workflow builders, coordination fixtures
