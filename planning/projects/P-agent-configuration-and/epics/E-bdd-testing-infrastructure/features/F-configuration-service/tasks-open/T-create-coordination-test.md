# Create Coordination Test Fixtures and Infrastructure

## Context and Purpose

Create comprehensive test fixtures and infrastructure to support complex multi-service workflow orchestration tests for Configuration Service coordination. This task establishes the foundation for testing workflows that coordinate PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, and FileService.

## Detailed Requirements

### Test Fixtures Development

- **Multi-Service Workflow Scenarios**: Create JSON fixture files with complex workflow definitions coordinating multiple services
- **Communication Pattern Examples**: Create fixture data representing different inter-service communication patterns with success and failure scenarios
- **System Consistency Scenarios**: Create test data representing configuration changes that affect multiple services and require consistency validation

### Infrastructure Components

- **Service Coordination Mocks**: Extend existing mock factories to support complex multi-service orchestration scenarios
- **Workflow State Management**: Create utilities for managing and tracking workflow state across service interactions
- **Performance Testing Support**: Create helpers for measuring coordination performance across service boundaries

## Technical Approach

### File Structure to Create

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/fixtures/
├── service-coordination/
│   ├── multi-service-workflows.json
│   ├── communication-patterns.json
│   └── consistency-scenarios.json
```

### Key Components to Implement

1. **Multi-Service Workflow Fixtures** (`multi-service-workflows.json`):
   - Complex workflows requiring PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService coordination
   - FileService integration scenarios for configuration persistence
   - Workflow state transitions and validation checkpoints
   - Error scenarios and compensation workflows

2. **Communication Pattern Fixtures** (`communication-patterns.json`):
   - Request/response patterns between services with realistic payloads
   - Error propagation scenarios with context preservation
   - Retry and circuit breaker pattern test data
   - Service timeout and failure simulation scenarios

3. **System Consistency Fixtures** (`consistency-scenarios.json`):
   - Configuration changes affecting multiple services
   - Conflict resolution test cases
   - Eventual consistency validation scenarios
   - Cross-service dependency validation data

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ Multi-service workflow fixtures support complex orchestration scenarios
- ✅ Communication pattern fixtures cover success, failure, and retry scenarios
- ✅ System consistency fixtures validate cross-service configuration changes
- ✅ Mock factory extensions support realistic multi-service interactions
- ✅ Performance testing infrastructure measures coordination overhead accurately

### Integration Validation

- ✅ Fixtures integrate seamlessly with existing ConfigurationServiceMockFactory patterns
- ✅ Mock extensions maintain compatibility with individual service mock factories
- ✅ Infrastructure supports both unit and integration testing approaches
- ✅ Performance helpers provide consistent measurement across different test scenarios

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: Existing mock factory infrastructure, ConfigurationServiceMockFactory, service type definitions
- **External**: PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, FileService interface definitions
- **Test Infrastructure**: EnhancedTemporaryDirectoryManager, existing fixture patterns

## Security Considerations

- **Test Data Isolation**: Ensure fixture data doesn't contain production-like sensitive information
- **Mock Service Security**: Validate that mock services maintain proper authorization patterns
- **State Management Security**: Ensure workflow state tracking doesn't leak sensitive configuration data

## Performance Requirements

- **Fixture Loading Performance**: Fixture files load within 100ms for efficient test execution
- **Mock Service Performance**: Mock factories create service instances within 50ms
- **Coordination Overhead**: Infrastructure adds minimal overhead (<10ms) to test execution

## Testing Requirements

Since we're in the BDD red phase, this task should create test shells only using `it.skip()`. Create basic structure and infrastructure validation tests to ensure fixtures and mocks are properly configured and accessible to the main test files.

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing fixture patterns established in the codebase
- Ensure compatibility with Jest testing framework and existing BDD structure
- Create realistic but focused test data that covers edge cases without excessive complexity
- Use TypeScript for type safety in fixture definitions and mock extensions
