# Implement System-Wide Configuration Consistency Integration Tests

## Context and Purpose

Create comprehensive BDD integration tests for system-wide configuration consistency and cross-service validation through ConfigurationService coordination. This implements the "System-Wide Configuration Consistency" acceptance criteria from the feature specification, focusing on consistency validation, conflict resolution, and eventual consistency guarantees.

## Detailed Requirements

### Test File Implementation

Create `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-system-consistency.integration.spec.ts` with comprehensive test scenarios covering:

### Core Test Scenarios

#### AC-3: System-Wide Configuration Consistency

- **Configuration Change Propagation**: Test configuration changes propagate correctly across all affected services
- **Consistency Verification**: Validate consistency verification includes cross-service boundary validation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Test conflict resolution mechanisms handle concurrent configuration changes
- **State Consistency**: Ensure system state remains consistent during partial service failures

## Technical Approach

### BDD Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Configuration System Consistency Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: System-wide configuration consistency with cross-service validation", () => {
    it.skip("should maintain consistency across all services during configuration changes", async () => {
      // Given - Configuration changes affecting multiple services and components
      // When - Changes are propagated through ConfigurationService coordination
      // Then - System-wide consistency is maintained with eventual consistency guarantees
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

#### Configuration Propagation Testing

1. **Cross-Service Configuration Updates**:
   - Test configuration changes affecting PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService simultaneously
   - Validate change propagation maintains proper ordering and dependencies
   - Test configuration versioning and consistency across service boundaries
   - Ensure FileService receives and persists configuration changes consistently

2. **Cascade Update Scenarios**:
   - Test configuration changes that trigger cascading updates across multiple services
   - Validate dependency chain resolution maintains consistency throughout propagation
   - Test update rollback when cascade operations fail partially
   - Ensure cascade completion detection and status reporting

3. **Configuration State Synchronization**:
   - Test system-wide configuration state synchronization after updates
   - Validate eventual consistency achievement across all service boundaries
   - Test synchronization recovery from partial failure scenarios
   - Ensure configuration drift detection and automatic correction

#### Conflict Resolution and Consistency

1. **Concurrent Modification Handling**:
   - Test conflict resolution when multiple services modify related configurations simultaneously
   - Validate optimistic locking mechanisms prevent configuration corruption
   - Test conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins, merge, user-resolution)
   - Ensure conflict resolution maintains data integrity and system consistency

2. **Consistency Validation Across Services**:
   - Test cross-service consistency validation for complex configuration dependencies
   - Validate referential integrity maintenance across service boundaries
   - Test consistency verification performance for large configuration sets
   - Ensure consistency violation detection and automatic remediation

3. **Partial Failure Recovery**:
   - Test system consistency maintenance during partial service failures
   - Validate configuration rollback when consistency cannot be maintained
   - Test recovery mechanisms that restore system to consistent state
   - Ensure failure isolation prevents system-wide consistency corruption

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ Configuration changes propagate correctly across all affected services with proper validation
- ✅ Consistency verification validates configuration integrity across service boundaries comprehensively
- ✅ Conflict resolution mechanisms handle concurrent configuration changes without data loss
- ✅ System state remains consistent even during partial service failures and recovery scenarios
- ✅ Eventual consistency guarantees are met within acceptable time bounds (<5 seconds)

### Integration Validation

- ✅ ConfigurationService coordinates consistency validation across PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService
- ✅ FileService integration maintains configuration persistence consistency during complex updates
- ✅ Cross-service dependency validation prevents inconsistent configuration states
- ✅ Configuration version management maintains consistency across distributed service updates
- ✅ Consistency monitoring provides real-time validation and alerting capabilities

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: T-create-coordination-test (consistency scenario fixtures), existing service mock factories
- **External**: ConfigurationService, PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, FileService consistency interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: System consistency fixtures, configuration versioning utilities

## Security Considerations

- **Configuration Access Control**: System-wide consistency operations maintain proper authorization across services
- **Consistency Audit Trail**: All consistency validation operations generate comprehensive audit logs
- **Secure Propagation**: Configuration change propagation preserves security context across service boundaries
- **Conflict Resolution Security**: Conflict resolution mechanisms protect sensitive configuration data

## Performance Requirements

- **Propagation Performance**: Configuration changes propagate across services within 2000ms
- **Consistency Validation**: Cross-service consistency validation completes within 1000ms
- **Conflict Resolution**: Conflict resolution mechanisms respond within 500ms
- **Recovery Performance**: Partial failure recovery restores consistency within 3000ms

## Testing Requirements

Since we're in the BDD red phase, implement all test scenarios using `it.skip()`. Focus on creating comprehensive test shells that:

- Define detailed Given-When-Then scenarios for each consistency validation type
- Include complex multi-service configuration scenarios with realistic data
- Set up proper mock services with configurable consistency behaviors
- Validate consistency guarantees, conflict resolution, and performance requirements
- Test both normal operation and failure recovery consistency scenarios

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing integration test patterns for multi-service consistency testing
- Use realistic configuration scenarios that demonstrate complex cross-service dependencies
- Include comprehensive consistency validation measurement and reporting
- Implement configurable consistency failure injection for thorough testing
- Ensure test scenarios validate both immediate and eventual consistency requirements
- Create reusable consistency testing utilities for future development and validation
