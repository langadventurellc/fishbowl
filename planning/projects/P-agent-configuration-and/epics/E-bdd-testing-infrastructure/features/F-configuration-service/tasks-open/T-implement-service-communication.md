# Implement Service Communication Pattern Integration Tests

## Context and Purpose

Create comprehensive BDD integration tests for service communication patterns and inter-service reliability through ConfigurationService coordination. This implements the "Service Communication Integration" acceptance criteria from the feature specification, focusing on communication reliability, error handling, and performance optimization.

## Detailed Requirements

### Test File Implementation

Create `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-service-communication.integration.spec.ts` with comprehensive test scenarios covering:

### Core Test Scenarios

#### AC-2: Service Communication Integration

- **Communication Error Handling**: Test graceful handling of service communication errors with retry mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: Validate communication patterns optimize for performance while maintaining reliability
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure message passing between services maintains data integrity and consistency
- **Fault Tolerance**: Test circuit breaker patterns and fallback mechanisms for service coordination

## Technical Approach

### BDD Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Configuration Service Communication Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Service communication reliability with error handling", () => {
    it.skip("should handle communication errors gracefully with retry mechanisms", async () => {
      // Given - Configuration operations requiring inter-service communication
      // When - Services communicate through ConfigurationService coordination
      // Then - Communication patterns maintain reliability with proper error handling
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

#### Communication Pattern Testing

1. **Request/Response Pattern Validation**:
   - Test synchronous communication patterns between ConfigurationService and dependent services
   - Validate request timeout handling and response validation
   - Test payload serialization/deserialization across service boundaries
   - Ensure communication metadata preservation throughout request/response cycles

2. **Asynchronous Communication Patterns**:
   - Test event-driven communication for configuration updates
   - Validate message queuing and processing for complex coordination scenarios
   - Test event ordering and consistency across service interactions
   - Ensure asynchronous operation completion tracking and state management

3. **Circuit Breaker and Fault Tolerance**:
   - Test circuit breaker activation when services become unavailable
   - Validate fallback mechanisms when primary communication fails
   - Test service recovery detection and circuit breaker reset
   - Ensure graceful degradation maintains system functionality

#### Error Handling and Recovery

1. **Network-Level Communication Failures**:
   - Test timeout scenarios for service communication
   - Validate retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Test connection pool exhaustion and recovery
   - Ensure network failure doesn't corrupt workflow state

2. **Service-Level Error Response Handling**:
   - Test handling of HTTP error codes from dependent services
   - Validate error context preservation across service calls
   - Test error aggregation for multi-service operations
   - Ensure proper error reporting to calling systems

3. **Data Integrity During Communication**:
   - Test checksum validation for large payload transfers
   - Validate transaction integrity across service boundaries
   - Test partial failure recovery in multi-service operations
   - Ensure data consistency despite communication interruptions

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ Service communication errors are handled gracefully with appropriate retry mechanisms
- ✅ Communication patterns optimize for performance while maintaining high reliability
- ✅ Message passing between services maintains complete data integrity and consistency
- ✅ Circuit breaker patterns provide effective fault tolerance for service coordination
- ✅ Error context preservation enables effective debugging and monitoring

### Integration Validation

- ✅ ConfigurationService coordinates effectively with PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService communication
- ✅ FileService integration maintains reliable communication during complex operations
- ✅ Communication failure recovery doesn't compromise system state or data integrity
- ✅ Performance monitoring validates communication efficiency across service boundaries
- ✅ Error aggregation provides comprehensive failure analysis for complex operations

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: T-create-coordination-test (communication pattern fixtures), existing service mock factories
- **External**: ConfigurationService, PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, FileService communication interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Communication pattern fixtures, network failure simulation utilities

## Security Considerations

- **Communication Security**: Inter-service communication uses encrypted protocols and proper authentication
- **Error Information Security**: Error messages don't leak sensitive configuration or system information
- **Request Security**: Service requests include proper authorization and validation
- **Audit Communication**: All inter-service communication generates appropriate audit logs

## Performance Requirements

- **Communication Latency**: Inter-service communication completes within 200ms for normal operations
- **Retry Performance**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff don't exceed 1000ms total
- **Circuit Breaker Response**: Circuit breaker activation responds within 50ms
- **Throughput Maintenance**: Communication patterns handle high-throughput scenarios without degradation

## Testing Requirements

Since we're in the BDD red phase, implement all test scenarios using `it.skip()`. Focus on creating comprehensive test shells that:

- Define detailed Given-When-Then scenarios for each communication pattern
- Include realistic communication failure scenarios and recovery expectations
- Set up proper mock services with configurable failure modes
- Validate error handling, retry logic, and performance requirements
- Test both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns comprehensively

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing integration test patterns for service communication testing
- Use realistic failure scenarios that reflect actual production challenges
- Include comprehensive performance measurement for all communication scenarios
- Implement configurable failure injection for thorough error testing
- Ensure test scenarios cover both happy path and edge case communication patterns
- Create reusable communication testing utilities for future test development
