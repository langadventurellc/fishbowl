# Configuration Error Handling Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for configuration error handling across all service integration scenarios, focusing on complex configuration failures, service coordination errors, and system-wide error recovery. These tests verify configuration errors are handled consistently with proper rollback and recovery mechanisms.

## Key Components to Implement

- **Complex Configuration Error Scenarios**: Test configuration errors affecting multiple services and components
- **Service Coordination Error Handling**: Verify error handling during multi-service configuration operations
- **Configuration Error Recovery**: Test configuration error recovery and rollback mechanisms
- **System-Wide Error Consistency**: Ensure configuration errors maintain system consistency and integrity

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Complex Configuration Error Integration

- **Given**: Configuration operations affecting multiple services with potential failure points
- **When**: Configuration errors occur during complex multi-service operations
- **Then**: Errors are handled consistently with proper rollback and error reporting
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Configuration creation errors trigger rollback across PersonalityService, RoleService, and AgentService
  - Configuration update errors maintain data consistency and prevent partial updates
  - Configuration deletion errors handle dependency conflicts with appropriate resolution guidance
  - Complex configuration errors provide comprehensive diagnostic information

### AC-2: Service Coordination Error Handling

- **Given**: Configuration operations requiring coordination across multiple services
- **When**: Service coordination failures occur during configuration workflows
- **Then**: Coordination errors are handled gracefully with proper cleanup and recovery
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Service communication failures during configuration operations trigger appropriate fallback mechanisms
  - Coordination timeout errors provide clear guidance for resolution and retry
  - Service availability errors maintain operation state for recovery workflows
  - Coordination error recovery preserves configuration consistency across all services

### AC-3: Configuration Error Recovery and Rollback

- **Given**: Configuration errors requiring recovery and rollback across multiple services
- **When**: Error recovery workflows are executed to restore system consistency
- **Then**: Recovery mechanisms restore system to consistent state with proper error handling
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Configuration error rollback restores previous state across all affected services
  - Recovery workflows handle partial rollback scenarios with appropriate completion mechanisms
  - Error recovery maintains audit trail and logging for troubleshooting
  - Rollback operations complete successfully even when additional errors occur during recovery

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Configuration Error Handling Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Complex configuration creation failure with rollback", () => {
    it.skip("should handle creation failure with complete rollback across services", async () => {
      // Given - Complex configuration requiring multi-service coordination
      // When - Configuration creation fails partway through the process
      // Then - Rollback mechanism restores system to consistent state
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Complex Error Scenario Testing**: Test configuration errors across multiple service boundaries
- **Coordination Error Testing**: Focus on service coordination failure scenarios and recovery
- **Rollback Mechanism Testing**: Verify configuration rollback and recovery mechanisms work correctly
- **System Consistency Testing**: Test system consistency maintenance during error scenarios

### Testing Requirements

#### Configuration Error Coverage

- ✅ Complex configuration creation errors with multi-service rollback
- ✅ Configuration update errors with consistency maintenance
- ✅ Configuration deletion errors with dependency conflict resolution
- ✅ Service coordination failure handling with recovery mechanisms
- ✅ Configuration error recovery workflows with state restoration
- ✅ System-wide error consistency with proper error propagation

#### Integration Error Validation

- ✅ ConfigurationService error handling coordinates with all dependent services
- ✅ Multi-service configuration errors trigger appropriate rollback mechanisms
- ✅ Configuration error recovery maintains system consistency and integrity
- ✅ Error handling integration preserves audit trails and diagnostic information

## Security Considerations

- **Configuration Error Security**: Configuration errors don't expose sensitive system information
- **Rollback Security**: Configuration rollback mechanisms maintain security constraints
- **Error Context Security**: Configuration error context respects security policies
- **Recovery Security**: Error recovery workflows maintain access controls and authorization

## Performance Requirements

- **Error Handling Performance**: Configuration error handling adds minimal overhead to operations
- **Rollback Performance**: Configuration rollback operations complete within acceptable time limits
- **Recovery Performance**: Error recovery workflows complete efficiently without impacting system performance
- **Error Memory Management**: Configuration error handling prevents memory leaks during extended operations

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-configuration-service (configuration coordination), F-validation-error-handling (validation errors), F-reference-error-handling (reference errors)
- **External**: ConfigurationService, ErrorHandlingService, RollbackService, and all component services
- **Test Infrastructure**: Complex error scenario builders, rollback mechanism mocks, configuration error fixtures
