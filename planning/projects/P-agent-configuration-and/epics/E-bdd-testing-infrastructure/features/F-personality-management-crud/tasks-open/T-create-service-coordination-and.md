# Create Service Coordination and Error Handling Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive skipped integration tests for service layer coordination and complex error handling scenarios in personality management operations. This task focuses on testing how PersonalityService integrates with ValidationService and PersistenceService while handling various error conditions gracefully.

## Implementation Requirements

### Service Coordination Testing

Create skipped tests for multi-service coordination:

- **PersonalityService + ValidationService**: Coordinate personality trait validation with business rule enforcement
- **PersonalityService + PersistenceService**: Coordinate data persistence with integrity checks
- **Transaction-like Operations**: Test multi-service operations that must maintain consistency
- **Service Communication**: Test internal API contracts and data flow between services

### Error Handling Integration

Implement comprehensive error scenario testing:

- **Validation Errors**: Context preservation across service boundaries
- **Database Constraint Violations**: Translation to business-friendly errors
- **Concurrent Modification**: Detection and handling of simultaneous operations
- **Service Communication Failures**: Graceful degradation and recovery

## Specific Implementation Approach

### Multi-Service Transaction Testing

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Coordinating personality creation across multiple services", () => {
  it.skip("should maintain consistency when PersonalityService coordinates with ValidationService and PersistenceService", async () => {
    // Given - Complex personality data requiring multi-service validation
    // When - PersonalityService coordinates creation across services
    // Then - All services maintain consistency or rollback completely
  });
});
```

### Error Propagation and Context Preservation

Test how errors maintain context through service layers:

- Service-specific error context is preserved
- Error aggregation from multiple service failures
- Business logic errors vs technical infrastructure errors
- Error recovery and fallback strategies

### Concurrent Access and Optimistic Locking

Create skipped tests for:

- Multiple users modifying the same personality simultaneously
- Optimistic locking strategies in service coordination
- Conflict resolution when services have competing operations
- Data integrity preservation during concurrent access

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Service Coordination Integration

- ✅ PersonalityService coordinates effectively with ValidationService for trait validation
- ✅ PersonalityService coordinates with PersistenceService for data operations
- ✅ Multi-service operations maintain transactional consistency
- ✅ Service communication failures are detected and handled appropriately

### AC-2: Error Context Preservation

- ✅ Validation errors maintain full context when propagated across service boundaries
- ✅ Database constraint violations are translated to meaningful business errors
- ✅ Service-specific error information is preserved for debugging and audit purposes
- ✅ Error aggregation provides comprehensive failure context for complex operations

### AC-3: Concurrent Modification Handling

- ✅ Concurrent personality modifications are detected and managed appropriately
- ✅ Optimistic locking prevents data corruption during simultaneous service operations
- ✅ Conflict resolution strategies provide graceful handling of competing operations
- ✅ Data integrity is preserved during high-concurrency scenarios

### AC-4: Service Recovery and Fallback

- ✅ Service communication failures trigger appropriate fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Partial service failures allow graceful degradation of functionality
- ✅ Recovery strategies enable resumption of operations after transient failures
- ✅ Transaction rollback preserves data consistency across all coordinated services

## Testing Requirements

Include comprehensive skipped test coverage for:

- **Cross-Service Operations**: Multi-service personality management workflows
- **Error Propagation**: Complex error scenarios across service boundaries
- **Concurrency Control**: Simultaneous access and modification handling
- **Service Communication**: Internal API contracts and data flow validation
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Fallback and rollback strategies for service failures

## Security Considerations

Include skipped tests for:

- Authorization context preservation across service boundaries
- Audit logging for multi-service operations
- Data protection during service coordination
- Security context validation for cross-service operations

## Performance Requirements

Create skipped tests to verify:

- Service coordination completes within 500ms under normal load
- Cross-service operations minimize data transfer and API calls
- Memory management prevents leaks during extended service coordination
- Error handling overhead doesn't significantly impact operation performance

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: T-create-personality-crud (foundational test structure)
- **Internal**: PersonalityService, ValidationService, PersistenceService interfaces
- **External**: Service coordination patterns, error handling frameworks
- **Test Infrastructure**: Mock factories for service dependencies, concurrency testing utilities

## Files to Create/Modify

- Enhance `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-management-service-coordination.integration.spec.ts`
- Add multi-service coordination test scenarios
- Create error handling and propagation test scenarios
- Implement concurrent access and conflict resolution tests
