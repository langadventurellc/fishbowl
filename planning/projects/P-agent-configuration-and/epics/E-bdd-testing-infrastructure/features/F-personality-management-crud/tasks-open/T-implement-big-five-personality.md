# Implement Big Five Personality Traits Validation Integration Test Scenarios

## Context

Create comprehensive skipped integration tests for Big Five personality model validation through service layer coordination. This task focuses on testing the validation of all 14 behavioral traits with proper business rule enforcement across multiple service components.

## Implementation Requirements

### Big Five Model Testing Coverage

Implement skipped tests for all personality dimensions:

- **Openness to Experience**: Creativity, curiosity, openness to new ideas
- **Conscientiousness**: Organization, discipline, goal-oriented behavior
- **Extraversion**: Social energy, assertiveness, positive emotions
- **Agreeableness**: Cooperation, trust, empathy
- **Neuroticism**: Emotional stability, anxiety, stress response

### 14 Behavioral Traits Integration

Create comprehensive validation tests for psychological trait combinations:

- Trait value range validation (0-100 with decimal precision)
- Trait interdependency validation according to psychological models
- Invalid trait combination detection and error handling
- Missing required trait detection with contextual error messages

## Specific Implementation Approach

### Validation Service Integration Testing

Test coordination between ValidationService and PersonalityService:

```typescript
describe("Scenario: Validating Big Five traits through service integration", () => {
  it.skip("should validate trait ranges through ValidationService coordination", async () => {
    // Given - Personality data with various trait values
    // When - Validation occurs through service integration
    // Then - Invalid ranges are detected and reported with context
  });
});
```

### Psychological Model Compliance Testing

Create skipped tests for:

- Trait value constraints based on psychological research
- Cross-trait validation rules (e.g., high Neuroticism with low Conscientiousness)
- Trait combination warnings for unrealistic psychological profiles
- Cultural and contextual trait interpretation validation

### Error Handling Integration

Test validation error propagation across services:

- Validation errors maintain context across service boundaries
- Business-friendly error messages for complex validation failures
- Error aggregation for multiple simultaneous validation failures
- Recovery strategies for partial validation failures

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Big Five Trait Range Validation

- ✅ Each trait validates 0-100 range with decimal precision support
- ✅ Invalid trait values trigger appropriate validation errors through service integration
- ✅ Boundary condition testing (0, 100, negative values, values >100)
- ✅ Null, undefined, and non-numeric value handling through validation service

### AC-2: Psychological Model Compliance

- ✅ Trait interdependency validation based on psychological research
- ✅ Detection of unrealistic trait combinations with contextual warnings
- ✅ Cultural sensitivity considerations in trait interpretation
- ✅ Age-appropriate trait range validation for different personality development stages

### AC-3: Service Integration Validation

- ✅ ValidationService properly coordinates with PersonalityService for trait validation
- ✅ Validation errors propagate correctly with full context preservation
- ✅ Batch validation supports multiple personality validation simultaneously
- ✅ Performance validation ensures trait validation completes within 50ms per personality

### AC-4: Error Handling Integration

- ✅ Complex validation errors maintain context across service boundaries
- ✅ Multiple validation failures are aggregated and reported comprehensively
- ✅ Error recovery strategies enable partial personality creation with warnings
- ✅ Validation audit trail supports debugging and compliance requirements

## Testing Requirements

Include comprehensive skipped test coverage for:

- **Trait Validation**: Individual trait range and type validation through service integration
- **Psychological Compliance**: Trait combination and interdependency validation
- **Service Coordination**: ValidationService and PersonalityService integration testing
- **Error Propagation**: Complex validation error handling across service boundaries
- **Performance**: Validation performance under various load conditions

## Security Considerations

Include skipped tests for:

- Input sanitization for all personality trait data at service boundaries
- Validation of personality data integrity during cross-service operations
- Protection against injection attacks through personality trait manipulation
- Audit logging for personality validation operations

## Performance Requirements

Create skipped tests to verify:

- Big Five trait validation completes within 50ms per personality
- Batch validation performance scales linearly with personality count
- Memory efficiency during large-scale validation operations
- Service integration efficiency minimizes cross-service communication overhead

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: T-create-personality-crud (foundational test structure)
- **Internal**: ValidationService, PersonalityService interfaces
- **External**: Psychological model validation rules, trait interdependency mappings
- **Test Infrastructure**: Test data builders for personality configurations

## Files to Create/Modify

- Enhance `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-management-validation.integration.spec.ts`
- Add comprehensive Big Five trait validation scenarios
- Create psychological model compliance test scenarios
- Implement validation error handling integration tests
