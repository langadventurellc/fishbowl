# Personality Management CRUD Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for personality management CRUD operations, focusing on Big Five personality model integration with 14 behavioral traits. These tests verify service layer coordination, data validation, and business logic enforcement across multiple components.

## Key Components to Implement

- **CRUD Operations Tests**: Create, Read, Update, Delete personality configurations through service integration
- **Big Five Model Integration**: Test all 14 behavioral traits with proper validation and constraints
- **Service Layer Coordination**: Verify personality service integrates correctly with data persistence and validation layers
- **Business Logic Validation**: Test personality trait combinations, constraints, and business rules

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Personality CRUD Integration Coverage

- **Given**: Personality service with Big Five model support
- **When**: CRUD operations are performed through service layer
- **Then**: All operations integrate correctly with validation and persistence layers
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Create personality with all 14 behavioral traits validates and persists correctly
  - Read operations return complete personality data with proper trait mapping
  - Update operations preserve data integrity and validate trait changes
  - Delete operations handle dependencies and referential integrity

### AC-2: Big Five Model Validation Integration

- **Given**: Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
- **When**: Personality data is processed through validation services
- **Then**: All trait values are validated within acceptable ranges and business constraints
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Trait values must be within 0-100 range with proper decimal precision
  - Invalid trait combinations trigger appropriate validation errors
  - Missing required traits are detected and reported through error handling
  - Trait interdependencies are validated according to psychological models

### AC-3: Service Integration Error Handling

- **Given**: Complex personality management operations across multiple services
- **When**: Error conditions occur during integration workflows
- **Then**: Errors are properly propagated with context and handled gracefully
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Validation errors maintain context across service boundaries
  - Database constraint violations are translated to business-friendly errors
  - Concurrent modification scenarios are detected and handled appropriately
  - Transaction rollback preserves data consistency across services

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Personality Management CRUD Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Creating personality with valid Big Five traits", () => {
    it.skip("should validate and persist personality through service integration", async () => {
      // Given - Valid Big Five personality data
      // When - Creating personality through service layer
      // Then - Personality is validated, persisted, and retrievable
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Mock Strategy**: Mock external dependencies (database, file system), test real internal service integration
- **Test Data Builders**: Use builder pattern for complex personality configurations with fluent API
- **Service Integration Focus**: Test coordination between PersonalityService, ValidationService, and PersistenceService
- **Error Scenario Coverage**: Test validation failures, constraint violations, and service communication errors

### Testing Requirements

#### Integration Test Coverage

- ✅ Personality creation with complete Big Five trait validation
- ✅ Personality reading with proper data transformation and mapping
- ✅ Personality updates with change validation and history tracking
- ✅ Personality deletion with dependency checking and cleanup
- ✅ Batch operations for multiple personality management
- ✅ Concurrent access handling and optimistic locking

#### Error Handling Validation

- ✅ Invalid trait values trigger service-level validation errors
- ✅ Missing required traits are detected during creation
- ✅ Constraint violations are properly handled and reported
- ✅ Service communication failures are gracefully managed

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All personality trait data is sanitized and validated at service boundaries
- **Authorization**: Personality operations respect user permissions and access controls
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive personality data is handled according to privacy requirements
- **Audit Logging**: CRUD operations are logged for compliance and debugging purposes

## Performance Requirements

- **Service Response Time**: Personality CRUD operations complete within 500ms under normal load
- **Validation Performance**: Big Five trait validation completes within 50ms per personality
- **Integration Efficiency**: Cross-service operations minimize data transfer and API calls
- **Memory Management**: Test cleanup prevents memory leaks during extended test runs

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: None (foundational personality management functionality)
- **External**: PersonalityService, ValidationService, PersistenceService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Test data builders, mock factories, temporary directory management
