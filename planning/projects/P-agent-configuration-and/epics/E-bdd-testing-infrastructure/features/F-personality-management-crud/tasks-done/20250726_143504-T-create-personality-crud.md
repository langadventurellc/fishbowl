# Create Personality CRUD Integration Test Structure

## Context

Create the foundational integration test structure for personality management CRUD operations as part of the BDD testing infrastructure. This task establishes the core test files with comprehensive skipped tests following the epic's patterns.

## Implementation Requirements

### File Structure

Create the personality management integration test files:

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-management-crud.integration.spec.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-management-validation.integration.spec.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-management-service-coordination.integration.spec.ts`

### BDD Test Pattern Implementation

Follow the epic's specified BDD structure:

```typescript
describe("Feature: Personality Management CRUD Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Creating personality with valid Big Five traits", () => {
    it.skip("should validate and persist personality through service integration", async () => {
      // Given - Valid Big Five personality data
      // When - Creating personality through service layer
      // Then - Personality is validated, persisted, and retrievable
    });
  });
});
```

### Core CRUD Operations Coverage

Implement skipped tests for:

- **Create Operations**: Personality creation with Big Five traits validation through service integration
- **Read Operations**: Personality retrieval with proper data transformation and mapping
- **Update Operations**: Personality updates with change validation and history tracking
- **Delete Operations**: Personality deletion with dependency checking and cleanup
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple personality management through service coordination

## Specific Implementation Approach

### Test Structure Requirements

- Use `describe("Feature: ...")` for top-level feature grouping
- Use `describe("Scenario: ...")` for specific test scenarios
- Use `it.skip("should ...")` for all test implementations
- Include Given-When-Then comments in each test body
- Follow 30-second timeout configuration for integration tests

### Big Five Personality Model Integration

Create skipped tests covering:

- Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism traits
- Trait value validation (0-100 range with decimal precision)
- Invalid trait combination handling
- Missing required trait detection
- Trait interdependency validation according to psychological models

### Service Integration Testing

Mock external dependencies while testing real internal service coordination:

- PersonalityService integration with ValidationService
- PersonalityService integration with PersistenceService
- Cross-service error propagation and context preservation
- Transaction-like operations across multiple services

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: File Structure Implementation

- ✅ Create all three integration test files in correct directory structure
- ✅ Follow naming convention: `personality-management-[capability].integration.spec.ts`
- ✅ Each file focuses on specific integration capability (CRUD, validation, coordination)
- ✅ Files are properly organized under `features/personality-management/` directory

### AC-2: BDD Pattern Compliance

- ✅ All tests follow Feature > Scenario > Test structure with `describe` blocks
- ✅ Every test uses `it.skip` to mark as pending implementation
- ✅ Given-When-Then comments are present in every test body
- ✅ Test descriptions clearly indicate expected behavior and integration scope

### AC-3: CRUD Operations Coverage

- ✅ Create personality with complete Big Five trait validation integration tests
- ✅ Read personality with data transformation and service coordination tests
- ✅ Update personality with validation and change tracking integration tests
- ✅ Delete personality with dependency management and cleanup tests
- ✅ Batch operations testing service coordination and transaction handling

### AC-4: Integration Testing Focus

- ✅ Tests focus on service layer coordination rather than individual component testing
- ✅ External dependencies (database, external APIs) are clearly marked for mocking
- ✅ Internal service integration is tested with real component interaction
- ✅ Error propagation and context preservation across services is covered

## Testing Requirements

Include comprehensive skipped test coverage for:

- **Service Integration**: PersonalityService coordination with ValidationService and PersistenceService
- **Business Logic**: Big Five trait validation, constraint enforcement, and psychological model compliance
- **Error Handling**: Validation failures, constraint violations, service communication errors
- **Performance**: Service response times, validation performance, cross-service efficiency

## Security Considerations

Include skipped tests for:

- Input validation and sanitization at service boundaries
- Authorization checks for personality operations
- Data protection for sensitive personality information
- Audit logging for compliance and debugging

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: None (foundational integration test structure)
- **External**: Jest testing framework, temporary directory management for test isolation
- **Integration**: PersonalityService, ValidationService, PersistenceService interfaces

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-management-crud.integration.spec.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-management-validation.integration.spec.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-management-service-coordination.integration.spec.ts`

### Log

**2025-07-26T19:35:04.369342Z** - Successfully implemented comprehensive personality CRUD integration test structure with three specialized test files covering all CRUD operations, Big Five validation scenarios, and service coordination patterns. All tests follow BDD Given-When-Then structure with it.skip() to establish expected behavior before implementation. Created Jest configuration and ESLint setup to support integration testing. All quality checks pass including linting, formatting, and type-checking. Total of 44 skipped tests implemented across 3 test files.
