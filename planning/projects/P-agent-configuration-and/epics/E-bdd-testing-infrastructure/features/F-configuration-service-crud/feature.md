# Configuration Service CRUD Integration Tests

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for configuration service CRUD operations, focusing on multi-service coordination for complete configuration lifecycle management. These tests verify ConfigurationService coordinates properly with PersonalityService, RoleService, and AgentService while maintaining data consistency and transaction integrity.

## Related Functional Work

This feature tests the functionality defined in:

- **[E-configuration-management](../../../E-configuration-management/epic.md)**: ConfigurationService unified interface, cross-service coordination mechanisms, and transaction-like consistency implementation

## Key Components to Implement

- **Cross-Service CRUD Coordination**: Test ConfigurationService coordination with multiple dependent services
- **Transaction-like Consistency**: Verify CRUD operations maintain consistency across service boundaries
- **Configuration Lifecycle Management**: Test complete configuration lifecycle from creation to deletion
- **Service Integration Error Handling**: Ensure error handling works correctly across service interactions

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Cross-Service CRUD Integration

- **Given**: ConfigurationService managing personalities, roles, and agents through respective services
- **When**: CRUD operations are performed across multiple service boundaries
- **Then**: All operations coordinate properly with appropriate rollback and consistency mechanisms
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Create operations coordinate across PersonalityService, RoleService, and AgentService
  - Read operations aggregate data correctly from multiple service sources
  - Update operations maintain consistency when changes affect multiple services
  - Delete operations handle dependencies and cascading deletions appropriately

### AC-2: Configuration Transaction Consistency

- **Given**: Complex configuration operations requiring multiple service interactions
- **When**: Operations are performed that span multiple service boundaries
- **Then**: Transaction-like consistency is maintained with proper rollback on failures
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Partial operation failures trigger appropriate rollback across affected services
  - Service communication failures are handled with proper cleanup mechanisms
  - Data consistency is maintained even during concurrent operations
  - Transaction boundaries are clearly defined and enforced across services

### AC-3: Configuration Lifecycle Integration

- **Given**: Complete configuration lifecycle requiring coordination across all services
- **When**: Lifecycle operations are performed through ConfigurationService
- **Then**: All lifecycle stages coordinate properly with dependent services
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Configuration creation integrates personality, role, and agent creation workflows
  - Configuration updates propagate changes correctly across dependent services
  - Configuration archiving handles dependencies and references appropriately
  - Configuration deletion ensures cleanup across all related services

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe("Feature: Configuration Service CRUD Integration", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Creating configuration across multiple services", () => {
    it.skip("should coordinate creation across PersonalityService, RoleService, and AgentService", async () => {
      // Given - Configuration data requiring multiple service coordination
      // When - Creating configuration through ConfigurationService
      // Then - All services coordinate properly with transaction consistency
    });
  });
});
```

### Technical Approach

- **Multi-Service Integration**: Test ConfigurationService coordination with PersonalityService, RoleService, and AgentService
- **Transaction Pattern Testing**: Focus on transaction-like consistency and rollback mechanisms
- **Lifecycle Management**: Test complete configuration lifecycle across service boundaries
- **Error Recovery Testing**: Verify error handling and recovery mechanisms work across services

### Testing Requirements

#### CRUD Integration Coverage

- ✅ Cross-service configuration creation with transaction consistency
- ✅ Multi-service configuration reading with data aggregation
- ✅ Configuration updates with cross-service change propagation
- ✅ Configuration deletion with dependency handling and cleanup
- ✅ Batch operations across multiple services with consistency guarantees
- ✅ Concurrent operation handling with proper conflict resolution

#### Service Coordination Validation

- ✅ ConfigurationService integrates properly with PersonalityService
- ✅ RoleService coordination maintains data consistency
- ✅ AgentService integration handles complex dependency scenarios
- ✅ Error propagation maintains context across service boundaries

## Security Considerations

- **Cross-Service Security**: Configuration operations maintain security context across services
- **Access Control**: CRUD operations respect permissions and authorization across all services
- **Data Integrity**: Configuration data is validated and protected across service boundaries
- **Audit Logging**: Cross-service operations are logged for compliance and security monitoring

## Performance Requirements

- **CRUD Performance**: Cross-service CRUD operations complete within 1000ms
- **Service Coordination**: Individual service interactions complete within 200ms
- **Transaction Overhead**: Transaction consistency mechanisms add minimal performance overhead
- **Batch Efficiency**: Batch operations are optimized to minimize cross-service communication

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: F-agent-configuration-creation (agent management foundation)
- **External**: ConfigurationService, PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService, TransactionService interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Multi-service mock coordination, transaction builders, configuration fixtures
