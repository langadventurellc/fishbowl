# Implement Configuration Lifecycle Management Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for complete configuration lifecycle management through ConfigurationService coordination with dependent services. Tests focus on AC-3: Configuration Lifecycle Integration from the feature specification, covering creation, updates, archiving, and deletion workflows.

See `planning/projects/P-agent-configuration-and/epics/E-configuration-management/epic.md` for details on the configuration management epic and its requirements.

## Technical Approach

### Lifecycle Management Stages

- **Configuration Creation**: Integration workflow for personality, role, and agent creation coordination
- **Configuration Updates**: Change propagation across dependent services with consistency maintenance
- **Configuration Archiving**: Dependency handling and reference management during archiving
- **Configuration Deletion**: Cleanup across all related services with dependency validation

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe("Feature: Configuration Service CRUD Integration Tests", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Complete configuration lifecycle management", () => {
    it.skip("should coordinate complete configuration lifecycle across all services", async () => {
      // Given - Complete configuration lifecycle requiring coordination across all services
      // When - Lifecycle operations are performed through ConfigurationService
      // Then - All lifecycle stages coordinate properly with dependent services
    });
  });
});
```

## Implementation Details

### Configuration Creation Integration Workflow

```typescript
it.skip("should integrate configuration creation workflow across personality, role, and agent services", async () => {
  // Given - Configuration creation requiring integrated workflow coordination
  const lifecycleCreateRequest: ConfigCreateRequest = {
    name: "Lifecycle Integration Config",
    description: "Configuration for testing complete lifecycle integration",
    personality: {
      name: "Lifecycle Personality",
      traits: ["systematic", "thorough"],
      behaviorPatterns: ["methodical-analysis"],
    },
    role: {
      name: "Lifecycle Coordinator",
      capabilities: ["workflow-management", "dependency-tracking"],
      constraints: ["lifecycle-compliance"],
    },
    agent: {
      name: "Lifecycle Agent",
      modelId: "gpt-4-turbo",
      settings: { temperature: 0.6, maxTokens: 2048 },
    },
  };

  // When - Configuration creation integrates across all services
  const { result: createdConfig, duration: creationDuration } =
    await PerformanceTestHelper.measureExecutionTime(async () => {
      return configurationService.createConfiguration(lifecycleCreateRequest);
    });

  // Then - Creation workflow integrates properly across dependent services
  expect(createdConfig).toBeDefined();
  expect(creationDuration).toBeLessThan(1000);

  // Verify integrated workflow coordination
  expect(personalityService.createPersonality).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.objectContaining(lifecycleCreateRequest.personality),
  );
  expect(roleService.createRole).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.objectContaining(lifecycleCreateRequest.role),
  );
  expect(agentService.createAgent).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.objectContaining(lifecycleCreateRequest.agent),
  );
});
```

### Configuration Update Propagation

```typescript
it.skip("should propagate configuration updates correctly across dependent services", async () => {
  // Given - Existing configuration requiring updates across multiple services
  const existingConfigId = "config-lifecycle-update-test";
  const updateRequest: ConfigUpdateRequest = {
    personality: { traits: ["analytical", "systematic", "adaptive"] },
    role: { capabilities: ["advanced-reasoning", "workflow-management"] },
    agent: { settings: { temperature: 0.7, maxTokens: 3072 } },
  };

  // When - Configuration updates propagate across dependent services
  const updatedConfig = await configurationService.updateConfiguration(
    existingConfigId,
    updateRequest,
  );

  // Then - Updates propagate correctly across all dependent services
  expect(updatedConfig).toBeDefined();

  // Verify update propagation coordination
  expect(personalityService.updatePersonality).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(roleService.updateRole).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(agentService.updateAgent).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### Configuration Archiving with Dependency Handling

```typescript
it.skip("should handle dependencies and references appropriately during configuration archiving", async () => {
  // Given - Configuration with dependencies requiring archiving workflow
  const configToArchive = "config-lifecycle-archive-test";

  // When - Configuration archiving handles dependencies and references
  await configurationService.archiveConfiguration(configToArchive);

  // Then - Dependencies and references handled appropriately
  expect(personalityService.archivePersonality).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(roleService.archiveRole).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(agentService.archiveAgent).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### Configuration Deletion with Service Cleanup

```typescript
it.skip("should ensure cleanup across all related services during configuration deletion", async () => {
  // Given - Configuration requiring deletion with comprehensive cleanup
  const configToDelete = "config-lifecycle-delete-test";

  // When - Configuration deletion ensures cleanup across related services
  await configurationService.deleteConfiguration(configToDelete);

  // Then - Cleanup ensured across all related services
  expect(personalityService.deletePersonality).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(roleService.deleteRole).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(agentService.deleteAgent).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-3: Configuration Lifecycle Integration

- ✅ Configuration creation integrates personality, role, and agent creation workflows with proper coordination
- ✅ Configuration updates propagate changes correctly across dependent services with consistency validation
- ✅ Configuration archiving handles dependencies and references appropriately with relationship preservation
- ✅ Configuration deletion ensures cleanup across all related services with dependency verification

### Lifecycle Performance

- ✅ Complete lifecycle operations complete within 1000ms performance requirement
- ✅ Individual lifecycle stage operations complete within 200ms
- ✅ Lifecycle coordination overhead is minimized and measured

### Service Coordination

- ✅ Lifecycle stages maintain proper coordination sequence across services
- ✅ Dependency validation occurs at each lifecycle stage
- ✅ Error handling preserves lifecycle state throughout operations
- ✅ Service coordination maintains data integrity across lifecycle stages

## File Structure

Create the following test file:

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/
└── configuration-lifecycle-management.integration.spec.ts
```

## Dependencies

- ConfigurationService mock factory with lifecycle methods (T-create-configuration-service)
- PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService mocks with lifecycle operations
- Lifecycle test fixtures for various lifecycle scenarios
- PerformanceTestHelper for lifecycle timing measurements

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for each lifecycle stage with comprehensive coverage
- Integration testing for complete lifecycle workflows
- Performance testing for lifecycle operation timing
- Error handling validation for lifecycle failure scenarios
- Dependency validation testing for lifecycle coordination

## Security Considerations

- Lifecycle operations maintain security context throughout the process
- Access control validation for each lifecycle stage
- Data integrity preservation during lifecycle transitions
- Audit logging for complete lifecycle operation tracking
