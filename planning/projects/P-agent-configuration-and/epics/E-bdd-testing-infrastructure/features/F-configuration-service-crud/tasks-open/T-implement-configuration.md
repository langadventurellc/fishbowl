# Implement Configuration Transaction Consistency Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for ConfigurationService transaction-like consistency across service boundaries. Tests focus on AC-2: Configuration Transaction Consistency from the feature specification, ensuring CRUD operations maintain consistency with proper rollback mechanisms.

See `planning/projects/P-agent-configuration-and/epics/E-configuration-management/epic.md` for details on the configuration management epic and its requirements.

## Technical Approach

### Transaction Consistency Patterns

- **Transaction Boundaries**: Test clearly defined transaction boundaries across multiple services
- **Atomic Operations**: Ensure configuration operations are atomic across service boundaries
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Test rollback capabilities when partial operations fail
- **Consistency Validation**: Verify data consistency maintained during concurrent operations

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe("Feature: Configuration Service CRUD Integration Tests", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Configuration transaction consistency across services", () => {
    it.skip("should maintain transaction-like consistency with proper rollback on failures", async () => {
      // Given - Complex configuration operations requiring multiple service interactions
      // When - Operations are performed that span multiple service boundaries
      // Then - Transaction-like consistency is maintained with proper rollback on failures
    });
  });
});
```

## Implementation Details

### Transaction-like Consistency Testing

```typescript
it.skip("should maintain transaction consistency across service boundaries", async () => {
  // Given - Configuration requiring coordinated transaction across services
  const transactionRequest: ConfigCreateRequest = {
    name: "Transaction Consistency Test Config",
    personality: { name: "Test Personality", traits: ["analytical"] },
    role: { name: "Test Role", capabilities: ["reasoning"] },
    agent: { name: "Test Agent", modelId: "gpt-4" },
  };

  // When - Transaction executes across multiple service boundaries
  const transactionStartTime = Date.now();
  const result =
    await configurationService.createConfiguration(transactionRequest);
  const transactionDuration = Date.now() - transactionStartTime;

  // Then - Transaction consistency maintained with proper coordination
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
  expect(transactionDuration).toBeLessThan(1000);

  // Verify transaction boundary enforcement
  expect(personalityService.createPersonality).toHaveBeenCalledBefore(
    roleService.createRole as jest.Mock,
  );
  expect(roleService.createRole).toHaveBeenCalledBefore(
    agentService.createAgent as jest.Mock,
  );
});
```

### Rollback Mechanism Testing

```typescript
it.skip("should trigger appropriate rollback across affected services on partial failures", async () => {
  // Given - Configuration with intentional failure at specific service coordination point
  const failureRequest: ConfigCreateRequest = {
    /* request data */
  };

  // Configure service to fail at specific coordination point
  roleService.createRole = jest
    .fn()
    .mockRejectedValue(new Error("Role service coordination failure"));

  // When - Partial operation failure occurs during multi-service coordination
  let rollbackError: Error | undefined;
  try {
    await configurationService.createConfiguration(failureRequest);
  } catch (error) {
    rollbackError = error as Error;
  }

  // Then - Appropriate rollback triggered across affected services
  expect(rollbackError).toBeDefined();
  expect(rollbackError?.message).toContain("coordination failure");

  // Verify rollback coordination across services
  expect(personalityService.rollbackPersonality).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(configurationService.rollbackConfiguration).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### Concurrent Operation Consistency

Test data consistency maintained during concurrent operations across service boundaries.

### Service Communication Failure Handling

Test proper cleanup mechanisms when service communication fails during transaction execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-2: Configuration Transaction Consistency

- ✅ Partial operation failures trigger appropriate rollback across affected services with proper cleanup
- ✅ Service communication failures are handled with proper cleanup mechanisms and error context
- ✅ Data consistency is maintained even during concurrent operations with conflict resolution
- ✅ Transaction boundaries are clearly defined and enforced across services with performance monitoring

### Transaction Performance

- ✅ Transaction consistency mechanisms add minimal performance overhead (< 50ms)
- ✅ Rollback operations complete within 500ms performance requirement
- ✅ Concurrent transaction handling maintains system performance under load

### Rollback Verification

- ✅ Complete rollback verification across all affected services
- ✅ Rollback operation ordering follows reverse dependency chain
- ✅ Rollback error handling provides comprehensive failure context
- ✅ Service state verification after rollback completion

## File Structure

Create the following test file:

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/
└── configuration-transaction-consistency.integration.spec.ts
```

## Dependencies

- ConfigurationService mock factory with rollback capabilities (T-create-configuration-service)
- PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService mocks with rollback methods
- Transaction test fixtures for various failure scenarios
- PerformanceTestHelper for transaction timing measurements

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for transaction boundary enforcement with comprehensive coverage
- Rollback mechanism testing for all failure scenarios
- Performance testing for transaction overhead measurement
- Concurrency testing for transaction isolation and consistency
- Error handling validation for all transaction failure modes

## Security Considerations

- Transaction rollback maintains security context throughout the process
- Service authentication preserved during rollback operations
- Data integrity validation during transaction rollback
- Audit logging for transaction success and rollback scenarios
