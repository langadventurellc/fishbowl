# Implement Configuration Transaction Consistency Integration Tests

## Context

Implement comprehensive BDD integration tests for ConfigurationService transaction-like consistency across service boundaries. Tests focus on AC-2: Configuration Transaction Consistency from the feature specification, ensuring CRUD operations maintain consistency with proper rollback mechanisms.

See `planning/projects/P-agent-configuration-and/epics/E-configuration-management/epic.md` for details on the configuration management epic and its requirements.

## Technical Approach

### Transaction Consistency Patterns

- **Transaction Boundaries**: Test clearly defined transaction boundaries across multiple services
- **Atomic Operations**: Ensure configuration operations are atomic across service boundaries
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Test rollback capabilities when partial operations fail
- **Consistency Validation**: Verify data consistency maintained during concurrent operations

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe("Feature: Configuration Service CRUD Integration Tests", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Configuration transaction consistency across services", () => {
    it.skip("should maintain transaction-like consistency with proper rollback on failures", async () => {
      // Given - Complex configuration operations requiring multiple service interactions
      // When - Operations are performed that span multiple service boundaries
      // Then - Transaction-like consistency is maintained with proper rollback on failures
    });
  });
});
```

## Implementation Details

### Transaction-like Consistency Testing

```typescript
it.skip("should maintain transaction consistency across service boundaries", async () => {
  // Given - Configuration requiring coordinated transaction across services
  const transactionRequest: ConfigCreateRequest = {
    name: "Transaction Consistency Test Config",
    personality: { name: "Test Personality", traits: ["analytical"] },
    role: { name: "Test Role", capabilities: ["reasoning"] },
    agent: { name: "Test Agent", modelId: "gpt-4" },
  };

  // When - Transaction executes across multiple service boundaries
  const transactionStartTime = Date.now();
  const result =
    await configurationService.createConfiguration(transactionRequest);
  const transactionDuration = Date.now() - transactionStartTime;

  // Then - Transaction consistency maintained with proper coordination
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
  expect(transactionDuration).toBeLessThan(1000);

  // Verify transaction boundary enforcement
  expect(personalityService.createPersonality).toHaveBeenCalledBefore(
    roleService.createRole as jest.Mock,
  );
  expect(roleService.createRole).toHaveBeenCalledBefore(
    agentService.createAgent as jest.Mock,
  );
});
```

### Rollback Mechanism Testing

```typescript
it.skip("should trigger appropriate rollback across affected services on partial failures", async () => {
  // Given - Configuration with intentional failure at specific service coordination point
  const failureRequest: ConfigCreateRequest = {
    /* request data */
  };

  // Configure service to fail at specific coordination point
  roleService.createRole = jest
    .fn()
    .mockRejectedValue(new Error("Role service coordination failure"));

  // When - Partial operation failure occurs during multi-service coordination
  let rollbackError: Error | undefined;
  try {
    await configurationService.createConfiguration(failureRequest);
  } catch (error) {
    rollbackError = error as Error;
  }

  // Then - Appropriate rollback triggered across affected services
  expect(rollbackError).toBeDefined();
  expect(rollbackError?.message).toContain("coordination failure");

  // Verify rollback coordination across services
  expect(personalityService.rollbackPersonality).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(configurationService.rollbackConfiguration).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### Concurrent Operation Consistency

Test data consistency maintained during concurrent operations across service boundaries.

### Service Communication Failure Handling

Test proper cleanup mechanisms when service communication fails during transaction execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-2: Configuration Transaction Consistency

- ✅ Partial operation failures trigger appropriate rollback across affected services with proper cleanup
- ✅ Service communication failures are handled with proper cleanup mechanisms and error context
- ✅ Data consistency is maintained even during concurrent operations with conflict resolution
- ✅ Transaction boundaries are clearly defined and enforced across services with performance monitoring

### Transaction Performance

- ✅ Transaction consistency mechanisms add minimal performance overhead (< 50ms)
- ✅ Rollback operations complete within 500ms performance requirement
- ✅ Concurrent transaction handling maintains system performance under load

### Rollback Verification

- ✅ Complete rollback verification across all affected services
- ✅ Rollback operation ordering follows reverse dependency chain
- ✅ Rollback error handling provides comprehensive failure context
- ✅ Service state verification after rollback completion

## File Structure

Create the following test file:

```
packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/
└── configuration-transaction-consistency.integration.spec.ts
```

## Dependencies

- ConfigurationService mock factory with rollback capabilities (T-create-configuration-service)
- PersonalityService, RoleService, AgentService mocks with rollback methods
- Transaction test fixtures for various failure scenarios
- PerformanceTestHelper for transaction timing measurements

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for transaction boundary enforcement with comprehensive coverage
- Rollback mechanism testing for all failure scenarios
- Performance testing for transaction overhead measurement
- Concurrency testing for transaction isolation and consistency
- Error handling validation for all transaction failure modes

## Security Considerations

- Transaction rollback maintains security context throughout the process
- Service authentication preserved during rollback operations
- Data integrity validation during transaction rollback
- Audit logging for transaction success and rollback scenarios

### 🚧 REMAINING WORK (High Priority)

#### 1. Create TransactionTestHelpers Utility Class

**File**: `/packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/support/TransactionTestHelpers.ts` (NEW FILE)

```typescript
/**
 * Transaction Test Helper Utilities
 * Provides specialized utilities for testing transaction consistency,
 * call ordering, rollback mechanisms, and performance validation
 */

export class TransactionTestHelpers {
  /**
   * Verify that mockA was called before mockB based on call timestamps
   */
  static expectCalledBefore(
    mockA: jest.MockedFunction<any>,
    mockB: jest.MockedFunction<any>,
  ) {
    expect(mockA).toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(mockB).toHaveBeenCalled();

    const mockATime = (mockA as any).lastCallTime || 0;
    const mockBTime = (mockB as any).lastCallTime || 0;

    expect(mockATime).toBeLessThan(mockBTime);
  }

  /**
   * Verify rollback operations occurred in reverse dependency order
   */
  static expectRollbackOrder(
    personalityService: any,
    roleService: any,
    configurationService: any,
  ) {
    // Verify all rollback methods were called
    expect(personalityService.rollbackPersonality).toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(configurationService.rollbackConfiguration).toHaveBeenCalled();

    // Get call timestamps for ordering verification
    const personalityRollbackTime =
      (personalityService.rollbackPersonality as any).lastCallTime || 0;
    const configRollbackTime =
      (configurationService.rollbackConfiguration as any).lastCallTime || 0;

    // Verify rollback occurred in reverse order (last created service rolls back first)
    expect(personalityRollbackTime).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(
      configRollbackTime - 100,
    ); // Allow some timing variance
  }

  /**
   * Verify transaction performance meets requirements
   */
  static expectTransactionPerformance(duration: number, maxAllowed: number) {
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(maxAllowed);
    expect(duration).toBeGreaterThan(0); // Sanity check
  }
}
```

#### 2. Create Main Test File

**File**: `/packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/configuration-service-integration/configuration-transaction-consistency.integration.spec.ts` (NEW FILE)

**Structure**: Follow the detailed implementation plan provided by the implementation planner. Key components:

- **Imports**: All enhanced mock factories, test helpers, data builders
- **Test Constants**: Performance timeouts (50ms overhead, 500ms rollback, 1000ms concurrent)
- **Three Main Scenarios**:
  1. Transaction boundary enforcement across services
  2. Rollback mechanism validation across affected services
  3. Concurrent operation handling with conflict resolution

**Key Test Methods** (all with `it.skip`):

- `should maintain transaction consistency across service boundaries`
- `should enforce transaction boundaries with performance monitoring`
- `should trigger appropriate rollback across affected services on partial failures`
- `should complete rollback operations within performance requirements`
- `should maintain data consistency during concurrent operations with conflict resolution`
- `should handle service communication failures with proper cleanup mechanisms`

#### 3. Implementation Details

**Mock Setup Pattern**:

```typescript
let configurationService: any;
let personalityService: any;
let roleService: any;
let agentService: any;

beforeEach(() => {
  configurationService =
    ConfigurationServiceMockFactory.createWithTransactionSupport();
  personalityService =
    PersonalityServiceMockFactory.createWithRollbackSupport();
  roleService = RoleServiceMockFactory.createWithRollbackSupport();
  agentService = AgentServiceMockFactory.createWithRollbackSupport();
});
```

**Data Pattern**:

```typescript
const transactionRequest: UnifiedConfigurationRequest = {
  personality: new PersonalityDataBuilder()
    .withName("Transaction Test Personality")
    .withValidBigFiveTraits()
    .withValidBehavioralTraits()
    .buildComplete(),
  role: RoleTestDataBuilder.createCustomRole({
    name: "Transaction Test Role",
    capabilities: ["reasoning", "analysis"],
  }),
  agent: AgentTestDataBuilder.createValidAgentConfig({
    name: "Transaction Test Agent",
    modelId: "gpt-4",
  }),
};
```

### 🔧 FINAL STEPS

#### 4. Quality Assurance

1. **Run Quality Checks**: `pnpm quality` from project root
2. **Run Test Suite**: `pnpm test` to verify no regressions
3. **Verify BDD Structure**: Ensure all tests use `it.skip` and proper `describe` hierarchy

#### 5. Task Completion Criteria

- [ ] TransactionTestHelpers utility class created
- [ ] Main test file with all 6 test scenarios created
- [ ] All tests initially skipped with `it.skip`
- [ ] Proper BDD structure: Feature > Scenario > Test
- [ ] All quality checks pass (`pnpm quality`)
- [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] Performance requirements documented in tests (< 50ms, < 500ms, < 1000ms)

### 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

**Transaction Flow**:

1. `configurationService.createUnifiedConfiguration()` initiates transaction
2. Services called in dependency order: Personality → Role → Agent
3. On success: transaction completes with consistent data
4. On failure: rollback triggered in reverse order with cleanup

**Mock Integration**:

- Each service mock factory provides transaction-aware instances
- Call timing tracking for ordering verification
- Rollback method simulation for failure scenarios
- TypeScript interfaces ensure proper typing

### 📋 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA STATUS

All AC-2 requirements have corresponding test scenarios planned:

- ✅ **Partial operation failures**: Rollback test scenarios
- ✅ **Service communication failures**: Error handling test scenarios
- ✅ **Data consistency**: Concurrent operation test scenarios
- ✅ **Transaction boundaries**: Performance monitoring test scenarios

### 📁 FILES MODIFIED

- `ConfigurationServiceMockFactory.ts` - Added transaction support
- `PersonalityServiceMockFactory.ts` - Added rollback support
- `RoleServiceMockFactory.ts` - Added rollback support
- `AgentServiceMockFactory.ts` - Added rollback support

### 📁 FILES TO CREATE

- `TransactionTestHelpers.ts` - Call ordering and rollback verification utilities
- `configuration-transaction-consistency.integration.spec.ts` - Main test file with all scenarios

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Use Existing Patterns**: Follow established BDD structure from existing test files
2. **API Differences**: Task spec uses `createConfiguration` but actual service uses `createUnifiedConfiguration`
3. **Performance Testing**: Use existing `PerformanceTestHelper.measureExecutionTime()` and `PerformanceTestHelper.benchmark()`
4. **Fixture Data**: Rich test scenarios available in `transaction-consistency-tests.json`
5. **TypeScript**: All mock extensions use proper typing to avoid `any` types
