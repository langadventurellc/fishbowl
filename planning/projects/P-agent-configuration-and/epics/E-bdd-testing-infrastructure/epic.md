# BDD Testing Infrastructure Epic

## Purpose and Goals

Establish a comprehensive BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) testing foundation for the Agent Configuration and Management System using Jest integration tests. This epic implements the complete test suite structure with all tests initially skipped (`it.skip`), defining the expected behavior and acceptance criteria for all system components before any implementation begins.

**Integration Definition**: These tests verify integration between internal library components (services, models, utilities) while mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, external file systems). File operations may use temporary directories for test isolation.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### Integration Test Suite Structure

- **Personality Management Tests**: CRUD operations, validation, and business logic integration
- **Role Management Tests**: Predefined and custom role management with service integration
- **Agent Configuration Tests**: Complex composition with cross-service references and validation
- **Configuration Service Tests**: Multi-service coordination and internal file operations
- **Library Integration Tests**: Component interaction and error propagation

### BDD Test Organization

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Test Structure & Organization

**AC-1.1: Feature-Based Test Organization**

- Given: A comprehensive Agent Configuration library specification
- When: Integration tests are organized by business features
- Then:
  - Each feature has its own directory with focused test files
  - Test files follow naming: `feature-capability.integration.spec.ts`
  - Tests are organized by business capability, not technical layers
  - File names clearly indicate the feature and capability being tested

**AC-1.2: BDD Pattern Implementation**

- Given: Jest integration test framework
- When: All tests follow BDD structure with describe/it blocks
- Then:
  - Feature level: `describe('Feature: [Feature Name]', () => {})`
  - Scenario level: `describe('Scenario: [Scenario Description]', () => {})`
  - Test level: `it.skip('should [expected behavior]', async () => {})`
  - Each test has clear Given-When-Then comments within the test body

### AC-2: Test Coverage & Scenarios

### AC-3: Infrastructure & Tooling

  - Test data builders generate realistic configuration objects with fluent API
  - Mock factories provide consistent external dependency mocking
  - Temporary directory manager handles file operation test isolation
  - Custom Jest matchers simplify configuration and error assertions

  - Cleanup mechanisms reset library state between test runs

**AC-3.3: Mock Strategy Implementation**

- Given: External dependencies that must be isolated
- When: Mocking strategy is implemented
- Then:
  - Database operations are mocked at the data layer
  - External API calls are intercepted and mocked
  - File system operations use temporary directories where needed
  - Network requests are completely mocked out

### AC-4: Integration & Cross-Service Testing

**AC-4.1: Internal Service Integration**

- Given: Multiple configuration services that coordinate
- When: Cross-service integration tests are written
- Then:
  - Agent creation with personality/role dependencies tests service coordination
  - Configuration consistency across internal services is verified
  - Transaction-like operations across multiple components are tested
  - Internal API contracts between services are validated

**AC-4.2: Component Interaction Testing**

- Given: Library components that must work together
- When: Component integration tests are written
- Then:
  - Data flow between components is tested end-to-end
  - Component initialization order and dependencies are verified
  - Error boundaries between components are tested
  - Library-wide configuration affects component behavior correctly

## Technical Considerations

### Test Framework Configuration

- **Jest Configuration**: Optimized for integration testing with 30-second timeouts
- **Test Environment**: Node.js environment with temporary file system access
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock external dependencies, test real internal integration
- **Parallel Execution**: Test isolation supports parallel execution within suites

### File System Testing Approach

- **Temporary Directories**: Each test suite uses isolated temp directories via helper
- **Atomic Operations**: Test configuration file consistency and rollback scenarios
- **Cleanup Strategy**: Automatic cleanup via `afterEach` and `afterAll` hooks
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Use Node.js path utilities for platform independence

### Integration Test Patterns

- **Service Layer Integration**: Focus on business logic coordination between services
- **End-to-End Library Workflows**: User workflow simulation through public APIs
- **Error Propagation Testing**: Verify errors propagate correctly with context
- **Performance Expectations**: Configuration operations complete within reasonable time

### Mock Strategy Details

```typescript
// Example mocking approach
jest.mock("../external/database-client", () => ({
  DatabaseClient: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
    save: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: "test-id" }),
    find: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
    delete: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(true),
  })),
}));

// File operations use temp directories
const tempDir = await testDirManager.createTempDirectory();
const configService = new ConfigurationService({
  configPath: tempDir,
});
```
