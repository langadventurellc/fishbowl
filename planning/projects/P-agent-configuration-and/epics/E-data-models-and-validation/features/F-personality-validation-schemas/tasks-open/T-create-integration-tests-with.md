# Implement Integration Tests with PersonalityConfiguration Interface

Location of test file to implement: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-management-validation.integration.spec.ts`

## Purpose

Ensure validation schemas correctly integrate with existing PersonalityConfiguration interface and related service layer operations, maintaining type compatibility and runtime safety.

## Context

Integration tests validate that the new Zod schemas work correctly with existing:

- PersonalityConfiguration interface usage
- Service layer personality operations
- Test utilities and builders
- Cross-service compatibility checks

## Implementation Requirements

### Schema-Interface Compatibility

- Validate that inferred types match original interfaces exactly
- Test schema validation against existing test data builders
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing personality objects
- Verify service layer integration points

### Service Integration Points

Based on existing usage patterns:

- ValidationService mock integration
- ConfigurationService personality operations
- Cross-service coordination with agent and role services
- Database persistence layer compatibility

### Test Data Integration

- Integration with existing `PersonalityDataBuilder`
- Validation of existing test fixtures and mock data
- Custom matcher integration for validation results

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Schema validation works with all existing PersonalityConfiguration test data
- [ ] Type inference matches original interfaces exactly (no type errors)
- [ ] Integration with existing PersonalityDataBuilder test utilities
- [ ] ValidationService integration tests pass
- [ ] Cross-service compatibility validation works
- [ ] Existing custom matchers work with new validation schemas
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing personality-related code

## Technical Approach

1. Update integration test file in existing integration test structure
2. Use existing test builders and mock factories
3. Test schema validation against all existing personality test data
4. Verify type compatibility with TypeScript compiler
5. Test service layer integration points

## Integration Test Scenarios

- Validate schemas against PersonalityDataBuilder output
- Test with ConfigurationTestFixtures personality data
- Integration with ValidationServiceMock patterns
- Cross-service validation with agent configuration tests
- Template personality business rule integration

## Compatibility Verification

- Ensure no breaking changes to PersonalityConfiguration interface
- Verify service layer method signatures remain compatible
- Test backward compatibility with existing personality objects
- Validate that existing tests continue to pass
