# Cross-System Validation Integration Feature

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement validation logic that coordinates between different configuration types and validates cross-references, dependencies, and business rules that span multiple data models. This feature ensures data consistency and integrity across the entire agent configuration system.

## Key Components to Implement

- Agent configuration composition validation
- Cross-reference integrity checking (personality → agent, role → agent)
- Business rule enforcement across multiple entities
- Dependency validation and circular reference detection
- Integration with existing ValidationService interface

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Agent Configuration Composition Validation

- Given: Agents compose personality, role, and model configurations
- When: Cross-system validation is implemented
- Then:
  - validateAgentComposition(agent, personality, role, model) checks compatibility
  - Personality traits are compatible with role requirements
  - Model capabilities support both personality and role needs
  - Agent settings don't conflict with personality or role constraints
  - Validation provides detailed compatibility analysis and recommendations

### AC-2: Cross-Reference Integrity Validation

- Given: Configurations reference each other by ID
- When: Reference integrity validation is implemented
- Then:
  - validatePersonalityReference(agentConfig) ensures personality exists and is accessible
  - validateRoleReference(agentConfig) checks role availability and compatibility
  - validateModelReference(agentConfig) confirms model exists and meets requirements
  - validateAllReferences(agentConfig) performs comprehensive reference checking
  - Reference validation integrates with existing service layer patterns

### AC-3: Business Rule Enforcement

- Given: Complex business rules span multiple configuration types
- When: Cross-system business rules are implemented
- Then:
  - Template personalities cannot be assigned to non-template agents
  - Predefined roles maintain immutability constraints when referenced
  - Model capabilities match personality trait requirements (high creativity → creative models)
  - Agent configurations respect role capability and constraint definitions
  - Business rules provide clear violation explanations and suggested fixes

### AC-4: Dependency and Circular Reference Detection

- Given: Configurations may have complex dependency relationships
- When: Dependency validation is implemented
- Then:
  - detectCircularReferences(configSet) identifies circular dependencies
  - validateDependencyChain(rootConfig) ensures dependency integrity
  - validateUpdateImpact(configId, changes) checks change propagation effects
  - Dependency validation scales efficiently for large configuration sets
  - Detection provides clear dependency path information for debugging

## Technical Requirements

- Implement cross-system validation in packages/shared/src/services/validation/
- Integrate with existing ValidationService interface
- Use dependency injection patterns for service coordination
- Ensure validation performance scales with configuration complexity
- Support both individual and batch cross-system validation

## Implementation Guidance

- Create validation orchestrator that coordinates individual service validations
- Use async/await patterns for efficient service coordination
- Implement caching for expensive cross-reference lookups
- Follow existing service layer patterns and error handling conventions
- Design validation to be extensible for future configuration types

## Testing Requirements

- Integration tests covering complex agent configuration scenarios
- Performance tests for cross-system validation with large datasets
- Edge case testing for circular references and invalid dependencies
- Mock service testing for validation service coordination
- End-to-end validation testing with realistic configuration data

## Security Considerations

- Ensure cross-system validation doesn't expose sensitive configuration data
- Validate that dependency checking doesn't create information leakage
- Prevent validation from being used for unauthorized configuration discovery
- Ensure validation services maintain proper authorization boundaries
- Implement rate limiting for expensive cross-system validation operations

## Performance Requirements

- Cross-system validation completes in <100ms for typical agent configurations
- Dependency detection scales logarithmically with configuration set size
- Validation caching reduces repeated cross-reference lookup costs
- Memory usage remains bounded during large batch validation operations
- Service coordination doesn't create performance bottlenecks

## Dependencies

- Enhanced data model schemas from previous features
- Existing ValidationService interface and service implementations
- Service layer components for configuration lookup and access
- Type guards and validation utilities for consistent error handling
