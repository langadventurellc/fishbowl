# Review CustomRoleSchema for Production Readiness

## Context

Review the existing CustomRoleSchema in `packages/shared/src/types/role/CustomRoleCore.ts` to ensure it meets production requirements and follows consistent validation patterns established by the personality schema system.

**Related files:**

- `packages/shared/src/types/role/CustomRoleCore.ts` - Main schema definition
- `packages/shared/src/types/role/CustomRoleCapability.ts` - Capability validation
- `packages/shared/src/types/role/CustomRoleConstraint.ts` - Constraint validation
- `packages/shared/src/types/role/CustomRoleMetadata.ts` - Metadata validation
- `packages/shared/src/types/personality/validation/PersonalityConfigurationSchema.ts` - Reference pattern

## Specific Requirements

### AC-1: Schema Structure Review

- Validate CustomRoleSchema follows consistent Zod patterns with personality schemas
- Ensure all required business rule validations are implemented
- Review field validation completeness against epic requirements
- Verify error message consistency and quality

### AC-2: Validation Pattern Consistency

- Compare UUID validation patterns with personality schema patterns
- Ensure string field validation includes XSS prevention measures
- Validate timestamp handling follows ISO string format patterns
- Check optional field handling consistency

### AC-3: Business Rule Validation

- Review template role immutability enforcement mechanisms
- Validate templateId cross-reference validation implementation
- Ensure role capability and constraint validation is comprehensive
- Check security context validation patterns

## Technical Implementation

1. **Analyze current CustomRoleSchema implementation**
   - Map current fields against epic AC-1 requirements
   - Document validation gaps or inconsistencies
   - Compare error message formats with personality schema standards

2. **Review related schema dependencies**
   - Examine CustomRoleCapabilitySchema for completeness
   - Review CustomRoleConstraintSchema validation rules
   - Assess CustomRoleMetadataSchema field coverage

3. **Document enhancement recommendations**
   - List specific validation improvements needed
   - Identify missing business rule enforcement
   - Note security validation gaps
   - Recommend error message standardization changes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete analysis document identifying validation gaps and inconsistencies
- [ ] Specific recommendations for bringing CustomRoleSchema to personality schema standards
- [ ] Business rule validation coverage assessment with missing rules identified
- [ ] Error message quality review with standardization recommendations
- [ ] Security validation assessment including XSS prevention review
- [ ] Documentation of templateId cross-reference validation effectiveness

## Testing Requirements

- Review existing integration tests in `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/role-management/role-custom-validation.integration.spec.ts`
- Identify test coverage gaps for recommended enhancements
- Note performance validation test requirements

## Dependencies

None - this is a review and analysis task.

## Definition of Done

Analysis complete with documented findings and specific recommendations for schema enhancement that align with personality validation patterns and production requirements.
