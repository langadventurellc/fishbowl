# Standardize Validation Patterns and Error Messages Across All Schemas

## Context

After enhancing individual Role, Agent, and Model schemas, ensure complete consistency in validation patterns, error message formats, and utility functions across all data model schemas. This task creates shared validation infrastructure and validates consistency standards are met.

**Related files:**

- `packages/shared/src/types/personality/validation/` - Established validation patterns
- `packages/shared/src/types/role/validation/` - Role validation utilities
- `packages/shared/src/types/agent/validation/` - Agent validation utilities
- `packages/shared/src/types/model/validation/` - Model validation utilities

## Specific Requirements

### AC-4: Cross-Schema Consistency (from Feature AC-4)

- Ensure all schemas follow the same error message format
- Validate UUID validation patterns are identical across schemas
- Confirm timestamp validation is consistent (ISO string format)
- Verify optional field handling follows the same patterns
- Standardize schema composition patterns

### Consistency Validation Areas

- Error message format and structure standardization
- UUID validation utility reuse and consistency
- Timestamp validation pattern alignment
- Optional field handling pattern unification
- Shared validation utility creation and adoption

## Technical Implementation

1. **Create shared validation infrastructure**
   - Create `packages/shared/src/types/common/validation/` directory
   - Extract common validation utilities from personality validation
   - Create shared error message constants and formatting utilities
   - Implement shared UUID, timestamp, and string validation utilities

2. **Audit and standardize validation patterns**
   - Review all enhanced schemas for pattern consistency
   - Identify and resolve validation pattern inconsistencies
   - Standardize error message formats across all schemas
   - Ensure consistent use of shared validation utilities

3. **Refactor schemas to use shared validation infrastructure**
   - Update personality validation to use shared utilities
   - Refactor role validation to use shared utilities
   - Refactor agent validation to use shared utilities
   - Refactor model validation to use shared utilities

4. **Create cross-schema validation tests**
   - Implement consistency tests that validate pattern uniformity
   - Test error message format consistency across all schemas
   - Verify shared utility usage across all validation implementations
   - Test validation performance consistency

5. **Update documentation and exports**
   - Update all schema JSDoc to reference shared validation patterns
   - Create comprehensive validation documentation
   - Update barrel exports to include shared validation utilities
   - Document validation best practices and patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Shared validation infrastructure created with common utilities
- [ ] All schemas use identical UUID validation patterns from shared utilities
- [ ] All schemas use identical timestamp validation (ISO string format)
- [ ] All schemas use consistent error message format and structure
- [ ] Optional field handling patterns standardized across all schemas
- [ ] Schema composition patterns standardized and documented
- [ ] Shared validation utilities properly exported and documented
- [ ] Cross-schema consistency tests implemented and passing
- [ ] All schemas refactored to use shared validation infrastructure
- [ ] Validation performance consistent across all schemas (<10ms requirement)
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation covering validation patterns and best practices

## Testing Requirements

- Create cross-schema consistency tests in `packages/shared/src/types/common/validation/__tests__/`
- Test error message format consistency across all schemas
- Test shared utility functionality and usage
- Verify validation performance consistency
- Test pattern standardization effectiveness
- Add regression tests to prevent future inconsistencies

## Security Considerations

- Ensure shared XSS prevention utilities are comprehensive and consistent
- Validate that shared security validation patterns cover all schemas
- Test that error message standardization doesn't leak sensitive information
- Ensure consistent security validation across all data models

## Dependencies

- Must complete enhancement tasks for Role, Agent, and Model schemas first
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing service implementations
- Must not impact existing integration test functionality
- Should coordinate with validation utilities from personality schema patterns

## Definition of Done

Complete standardization of validation patterns across all data model schemas with shared validation infrastructure, consistent error messaging, comprehensive cross-schema testing, proper documentation, and verified pattern compliance that maintains backward compatibility and security standards.
