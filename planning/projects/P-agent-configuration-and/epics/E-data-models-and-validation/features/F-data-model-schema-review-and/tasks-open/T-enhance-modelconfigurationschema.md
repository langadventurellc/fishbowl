# Enhance ModelConfigurationSchema for Production Readiness

## Context

Review and enhance the existing ModelConfigurationSchema in `packages/shared/src/types/model/ModelConfiguration.ts` to meet production requirements following the comprehensive validation patterns established by the personality schema system. The current schema appears minimal and needs significant enhancement.

**Related files:**

- `packages/shared/src/types/model/ModelConfiguration.ts` - Main schema definition
- `packages/shared/src/types/model/ModelCapabilities.ts` - Model capabilities
- `packages/shared/src/types/model/ModelConstraints.ts` - Model constraints
- `packages/shared/src/types/personality/validation/PersonalityConfigurationSchema.ts` - Reference pattern

## Specific Requirements

### AC-3: Model Schema Enhancement (from Feature AC-3)

- Enhance ModelConfiguration schema to validate all provider types
- Implement model capability validation covering all supported features
- Add performance constraint validation (comprehensive)
- Implement security and compliance validation rules
- Add cost and usage constraint validation

### AC-3: Comprehensive Enhancement Areas

- Provider-specific parameter validation (temperature, topP, penalties with proper ranges)
- Model capability enumeration and validation
- Performance benchmarks and constraints
- Security compliance requirements
- Cost and usage limitations

## Technical Implementation

1. **Analyze current ModelConfigurationSchema limitations**
   - Review current basic schema implementation
   - Identify missing validation for provider-specific parameters
   - Document gaps in capability and constraint validation
   - Compare against personality schema validation patterns

2. **Design comprehensive model validation enhancements**
   - Define provider-specific parameter ranges (temperature: 0.0-2.0, topP: 0.0-1.0, penalties: -2.0 to 2.0)
   - Create model capability validation schemas
   - Design performance constraint validation
   - Plan security and compliance validation rules
   - Design cost and usage constraint validation

3. **Implement validation enhancements with unit tests**
   - Enhance ModelConfigurationSchema with comprehensive validation
   - Add proper error messages following personality schema patterns
   - Implement XSS prevention for string fields
   - Add JSDoc documentation for all schema fields
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for all validation scenarios

4. **Integrate with existing model types and services**
   - Ensure compatibility with ModelCapabilities and ModelConstraints types
   - Verify integration with existing service interfaces
   - Test backwards compatibility with existing implementations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Enhanced ModelConfigurationSchema validates all provider types with specific parameter ranges
- [ ] Model capability validation covers all supported features with proper enums
- [ ] Performance constraint validation implemented with measurable benchmarks
- [ ] Security and compliance validation rules implemented and tested
- [ ] Cost and usage constraint validation complete with proper limits
- [ ] Error messages follow personality schema format and quality standards
- [ ] XSS prevention implemented for all string fields
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests achieve >95% coverage for all validation scenarios
- [ ] JSDoc documentation complete for all schema fields and validation rules
- [ ] Integration tests verify compatibility with existing service implementations

## Testing Requirements

- Create comprehensive unit tests in `packages/shared/src/types/model/validation/__tests__/`
- Test all provider-specific parameter validation scenarios
- Verify performance constraint validation edge cases
- Test security validation with malicious input scenarios
- Add integration tests for model service compatibility

## Security Considerations

- Implement XSS prevention for name, description, and provider fields
- Validate that parameter constraints prevent injection attacks
- Ensure no sensitive information leakage in error messages
- Add validation for potentially dangerous configuration values

## Dependencies

None - this is an enhancement task that can be completed independently.

## Definition of Done

ModelConfigurationSchema enhanced with comprehensive validation meeting personality schema standards, including provider-specific validation, capability validation, constraint validation, security measures, complete unit test coverage, and documentation.
