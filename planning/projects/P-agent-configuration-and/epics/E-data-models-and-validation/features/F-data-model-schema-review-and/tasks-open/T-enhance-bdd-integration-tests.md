# Enhance BDD Integration Tests for Schema Validation Coverage

## Context

After enhancing all data model schemas (Role, Agent, Model) and standardizing validation patterns, ensure comprehensive BDD integration test coverage exists for all validation scenarios, edge cases, and cross-service validation patterns. Focus on adding missing test coverage identified during schema enhancement.

**Related files:**

- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/role-management/role-custom-validation.integration.spec.ts` - Role validation tests
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/agent-configuration/agent-creation-validation.integration.spec.ts` - Agent validation tests
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/personality-management/personality-management-validation.integration.spec.ts` - Personality validation reference

## Specific Requirements

### Testing Requirements (from Feature)

- Implement applicable BDD integration tests in pre-existing test files
- Add missing test coverage for edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test cross-schema validation scenarios (agent referencing personality/role)
- Verify error message quality and consistency
- Test validation performance requirements

### Coverage Enhancement Areas

- Enhanced Role schema validation scenarios
- Enhanced Agent schema cross-service validation
- Enhanced Model schema comprehensive validation
- Cross-schema consistency validation testing
- Security validation testing with malicious inputs

## Technical Implementation

1. **Audit existing integration test coverage**
   - Review role-custom-validation.integration.spec.ts for coverage gaps
   - Review agent-creation-validation.integration.spec.ts for missing scenarios
   - Identify missing test scenarios for model validation
   - Document cross-schema validation test gaps

2. **Enhance Role validation integration tests**
   - Add tests for enhanced CustomRoleSchema validation patterns
   - Test template role immutability enforcement scenarios
   - Add templateId cross-reference validation test cases
   - Test role capability and constraint validation edge cases
   - Add security validation tests (XSS prevention)

3. **Enhance Agent validation integration tests**
   - Add tests for enhanced AgentSchema cross-service validation
   - Test personalityId and roleId reference validation robustness
   - Add model configuration validation integration scenarios
   - Test agent metadata validation completeness
   - Add cross-service validation performance tests (300ms limit)

4. **Add Model validation integration tests**
   - Create new integration test file if needed for model validation
   - Test enhanced ModelConfigurationSchema comprehensive validation
   - Add provider-specific parameter validation tests
   - Test model capability and constraint validation scenarios
   - Add performance and security validation test cases

5. **Create cross-schema validation integration tests**
   - Test validation consistency across all schemas
   - Add error message format consistency tests
   - Test shared validation utility effectiveness
   - Add regression tests for validation pattern consistency

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive BDD integration test coverage for all enhanced schema validation scenarios
- [ ] Role validation tests cover template immutability, cross-reference validation, and security scenarios
- [ ] Agent validation tests cover cross-service integration, reference validation, and performance requirements
- [ ] Model validation tests cover provider-specific validation, capabilities, and constraints
- [ ] Cross-schema validation tests verify consistency and shared utility effectiveness
- [ ] Security validation tests include XSS prevention and malicious input handling
- [ ] Performance validation tests verify <10ms schema validation and 300ms cross-service validation limits
- [ ] Error message quality tests ensure consistency and actionability across all schemas
- [ ] Integration tests achieve >95% coverage for all enhanced validation scenarios
- [ ] All tests follow BDD Given-When-Then structure with clear scenario documentation

## Testing Requirements

- Enhance existing integration test files in `packages/shared/src/__tests__/integration/features/`
- Add missing test scenarios identified during schema enhancement
- Create performance benchmarks for validation testing
- Add security test scenarios with malicious input patterns
- Test cross-service validation coordination effectiveness

## Security Considerations

- Test XSS prevention across all enhanced schemas
- Validate that enhanced schemas prevent injection attacks
- Test error message handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- Ensure cross-service validation maintains security standards

## Dependencies

- Must complete all schema enhancement and standardization tasks first
- Must not break existing integration test functionality
- Should coordinate with existing BDD test infrastructure and patterns
- Must maintain compatibility with existing service mock factories

## Definition of Done

Comprehensive BDD integration test coverage for all enhanced schema validation scenarios with security testing, performance validation, cross-schema consistency testing, and complete documentation that maintains BDD standards and provides robust validation regression testing.
