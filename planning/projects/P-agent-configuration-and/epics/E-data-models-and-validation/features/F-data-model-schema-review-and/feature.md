# Data Model Schema Review and Enhancement Feature

## Purpose and Functionality

Review and enhance existing Role, Agent, and Model validation schemas to ensure they meet production requirements and follow consistent patterns. This feature validates that existing schemas written for BDD test support are production-ready and complete.

## Key Components to Review and Enhance

- CustomRoleSchema and related role validation schemas
- AgentSchema and agent request/response schemas
- ModelConfiguration and model capability schemas
- Validation consistency across all data models
- Error message standardization and clarity

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Role Schema Validation Review

- Given: Existing role schemas support BDD testing
- When: Production readiness review is completed
- Then:
  - CustomRoleSchema validates all required business rules
  - Role capability and constraint validation is comprehensive
  - Template role immutability rules are properly enforced
  - Cross-reference validation (templateId) works correctly
  - Error messages are user-friendly and actionable

### AC-2: Agent Schema Validation Review

- Given: Agent schemas exist for basic agent configuration
- When: Schema completeness review is performed
- Then:
  - AgentSchema validates all agent configuration requirements
  - PersonalityId and roleId reference validation is robust
  - Model configuration validation integrates properly
  - Agent metadata validation covers all use cases
  - Settings and capabilities validation is comprehensive

### AC-3: Model Schema Enhancement

- Given: Model schemas exist but may need enhancement
- When: Model validation requirements are analyzed
- Then:
  - ModelConfiguration schema validates all provider types
  - Model capability validation covers all supported features
  - Performance constraint validation is comprehensive
  - Security and compliance validation rules are implemented
  - Cost and usage constraint validation is complete

### AC-4: Cross-Schema Consistency

- Given: Multiple schemas exist with potentially inconsistent patterns
- When: Consistency review is performed
- Then:
  - All schemas follow the same error message format
  - UUID validation patterns are identical across schemas
  - Timestamp validation is consistent (ISO string format)
  - Optional field handling follows the same patterns
  - Schema composition patterns are standardized

## Technical Requirements

- Ensure all schemas use consistent Zod patterns and validation rules
- Standardize error message formats across all data models
- Implement comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all schemas
- Ensure schema performance meets established benchmarks
- Validate schema exports are properly organized in barrel exports

## Implementation Guidance

- Review existing schemas in packages/shared/src/types/
- Compare against epic requirements for completeness
- Identify and fix inconsistencies in validation patterns
- Enhance error messages for better developer experience
- Add missing validation rules identified in epic specification

## Testing Requirements

- Validate existing integration tests still pass with enhanced schemas
- Add missing test coverage for edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure performance benchmarks are met for all schemas
- Test cross-schema validation scenarios (agent referencing personality/role)
- Verify error message quality and consistency

## Security Considerations

- Review all string field validation for XSS prevention
- Ensure UUID validation prevents injection attacks
- Validate that sensitive fields are properly handled
- Review constraint validation for security implications
- Ensure no information leakage in error messages

## Performance Requirements

- All schema validations complete within existing performance budgets
- Memory usage remains efficient for batch operations
- Schema compilation performance is optimized
- Error collection and reporting has minimal overhead

## Dependencies

- Must not break existing BDD integration tests
- Maintain compatibility with existing service layer implementations
- Coordinate with validation utilities and type guard implementation
