# Run Quality Checks and Fix Issues

## Context

After implementing all atomic UI components, run the project's quality checks to ensure code meets standards and fix any linting, formatting, or TypeScript issues.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Quality Check Commands

Run the following commands as specified in CLAUDE.md:

```bash
pnpm quality  # Run linting, formatting, and type checks
pnpm test     # Run unit tests to ensure functionality
```

### 2. Fix Any Issues Found

**Linting Issues:**

- Fix ESLint violations in component files
- Ensure consistent code style across all atomic components
- Address any unused imports or variables

**TypeScript Issues:**

- Resolve type errors in component prop interfaces
- Fix missing type annotations
- Ensure strict TypeScript compliance

**Formatting Issues:**

- Apply consistent code formatting
- Fix indentation and spacing issues
- Ensure consistent import ordering

### 3. Test Issues

- Fix any failing unit tests
- Ensure component tests pass
- Address component showcase integration issues

### 4. Documentation Review

- Verify JSDoc comments are complete and accurate
- Ensure prop interfaces have proper descriptions
- Check that README or component documentation is up to date

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ `pnpm quality` command passes without errors
- ✅ `pnpm test` command passes without failures
- ✅ All atomic components compile successfully
- ✅ No ESLint or TypeScript warnings
- ✅ Code formatting is consistent
- ✅ ComponentShowcase displays all components correctly
- ✅ No console errors in browser
- ✅ Components work in both light and dark themes

## Dependencies

- All atomic component tasks completed (AgentPill, ThemeToggle, Button, ThinkingIndicator)
- Existing barrel export file in apps/desktop/src/components/ui/atomic/index.ts

## Testing Requirements

- Verify all quality checks pass
- Ensure components render correctly in showcase
- Test theme switching functionality
- Confirm no runtime errors
