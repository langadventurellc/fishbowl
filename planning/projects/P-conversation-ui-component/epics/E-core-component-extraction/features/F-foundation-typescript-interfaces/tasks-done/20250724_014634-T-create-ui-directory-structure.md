# Create UI Directory Structure and Barrel Exports

## Context

Set up the foundational directory structure for UI TypeScript interfaces in the shared package. This task establishes the organization pattern that all subsequent interface creation tasks will follow.

## Implementation Requirements

### Directory Structure

Create the following directory structure in `packages/shared/src/types/ui/`:

```
packages/shared/src/types/ui/
├── index.ts (barrel export)
├── core.ts (Message, Agent, Conversation)
├── components.ts (component prop interfaces)
└── theme.ts (ThemeMode and styling types)
```

### Files to Create

1. **`packages/shared/src/types/ui/index.ts`** - Main barrel export file
2. **`packages/shared/src/types/ui/core.ts`** - Core data interfaces file
3. **`packages/shared/src/types/ui/components.ts`** - Component props interfaces file
4. **`packages/shared/src/types/ui/theme.ts`** - Theme and styling types file
5. **Update `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts`** - Add UI types to main types export

### Barrel Export Pattern

Follow the existing codebase pattern for barrel exports:

- Each file exports specific interfaces
- `ui/index.ts` re-exports everything from submodules
- Main `types/index.ts` exports the UI module

## Technical Approach

1. **Create directory structure** using the Bash tool
2. **Create placeholder files** with basic TypeScript module structure
3. **Set up barrel exports** with proper TypeScript export syntax
4. **Update main types index** to include the new UI module
5. **Include JSDoc comments** explaining the purpose of each module

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Directory Structure Created**

- All four required files exist in correct locations
- Directory follows shared package conventions

✅ **Barrel Exports Configured**

- `ui/index.ts` exports from all submodules
- `types/index.ts` includes UI types export
- All exports use proper TypeScript syntax

✅ **File Organization**

- Each file has clear purpose and JSDoc documentation
- Files follow TypeScript module conventions
- No circular import dependencies

✅ **TypeScript Validation**

- All files compile without errors in strict mode
- Proper TypeScript module structure
- Ready for interface implementations

## Dependencies

None - this is a foundational setup task

## Testing Requirements

- Directory structure exists and is accessible
- TypeScript compilation passes for empty modules
- Import paths resolve correctly from other packages

### Log

**2025-07-24T06:46:34.751726Z** - Created foundational UI directory structure with subdirectories and barrel exports that comply with the "one export per file" ESLint rule. Implemented organized file structure with packages/shared/src/types/ui/ containing core/, components/, and theme/ subdirectories, each with individual placeholder files and proper barrel exports. All TypeScript compilation, linting, and formatting checks pass successfully. Structure is ready for subsequent interface implementation tasks.
