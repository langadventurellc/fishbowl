# Create Integration Testing Suite for shadcn/ui Components

## Context

Develop comprehensive integration tests to ensure all shadcn/ui components work correctly with the existing application functionality, theme system, and user workflows. This testing suite validates the hybrid architecture approach.

## Implementation Requirements

- Create integration tests for all enhanced shadcn/ui components
- Test theme switching with shadcn/ui components
- Validate accessibility improvements from shadcn/ui integration
- Test component interactions and workflows
- Ensure performance requirements are met

## Detailed Steps

1. Set up integration testing framework for component testing
2. Create test suites for each integrated component:
   - Button component with all variants and states
   - Input/Textarea components with message functionality
   - Dialog components with modal workflows
   - ContextMenu components with right-click interactions
3. Create theme integration tests:
   - Light/dark theme switching with shadcn/ui components
   - CSS variable consistency across component types
   - Visual regression testing for theme changes
4. Create accessibility integration tests:
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation workflows
   - Focus management across component interactions
5. Create workflow integration tests:
   - Message sending with enhanced input components
   - Context menu actions (copy, delete, regenerate)
   - Dialog interactions (confirmation, form submission)
6. Performance testing:
   - Component render performance
   - Theme switching performance
   - Bundle size impact analysis
7. Document test coverage and patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ Integration test suite covers all shadcn/ui enhanced components  
✅ Theme switching tests pass for all component combinations  
✅ Accessibility tests verify improved screen reader support  
✅ Workflow tests validate user interaction patterns  
✅ Performance tests meet or exceed baseline requirements  
✅ Visual regression tests prevent styling inconsistencies  
✅ Test documentation provides clear coverage overview  
✅ CI/CD integration runs tests automatically

## Technical Notes

- Use React Testing Library for component integration testing
- Leverage Playwright for end-to-end workflow testing
- Implement visual regression testing with screenshot comparison
- Use accessibility testing tools (axe-core) for a11y validation

## Testing Categories

- **Component Integration**: All shadcn/ui components work in app context
- **Theme Integration**: Theme switching works with all component types
- **Accessibility Integration**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
- **Workflow Integration**: User workflows work with enhanced components
- **Performance Integration**: No performance degradation from changes

## Files to Test

- All components updated with shadcn/ui enhancements
- Theme switching functionality
- User workflow paths (message sending, context menus, dialogs)
- Cross-component interactions
