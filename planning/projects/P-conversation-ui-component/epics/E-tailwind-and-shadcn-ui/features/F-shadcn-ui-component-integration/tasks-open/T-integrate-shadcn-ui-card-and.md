# Integrate shadcn/ui Card and Separator Components

## Context

Integrate shadcn/ui Card and Separator components to provide structured content display throughout the application. These components can enhance the visual organization of content and provide consistent spacing and styling patterns.

## Implementation Requirements

- Install shadcn/ui Card and Separator components
- Identify opportunities for Card usage in existing layouts
- Replace custom dividers/separators with shadcn/ui Separator
- Create reusable Card patterns for different content types
- Ensure consistent styling with theme system

## Detailed Steps

1. Install shadcn/ui components:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest add card
   npx shadcn@latest add separator
   ```
2. Analyze codebase for Card usage opportunities:
   - Message items that could benefit from card styling
   - Settings panels or configuration sections
   - Sidebar sections that need visual separation
3. Identify existing separator/divider patterns to replace
4. Create Card component variations:
   - Message card for chat content
   - Settings card for configuration panels
   - Info card for status displays
5. Replace custom separators with shadcn/ui Separator:
   - Between menu items
   - In layout sections
   - Between content areas
6. Test visual consistency and spacing
7. Write unit tests for Card and Separator usage

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ shadcn/ui Card and Separator components installed  
✅ Card components integrated in appropriate locations  
✅ Custom separators replaced with shadcn/ui Separator  
✅ Consistent styling with existing theme system  
✅ Proper spacing and visual hierarchy maintained  
✅ Reusable Card patterns created for common use cases  
✅ Unit tests pass for Card and Separator components  
✅ Visual regression testing confirms improved layout

## Technical Notes

- Use Card for structured content that benefits from visual grouping
- Use Separator for consistent spacing between related elements
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure with Card components
- Maintain accessibility with proper heading hierarchy in Cards

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for Card component variations
- Visual regression testing for layout improvements
- Accessibility testing for proper semantic structure
- Responsive testing for Card layouts across screen sizes

## Files to Analyze for Integration

- Look for custom divider/separator implementations
- Identify layout components that could benefit from Card structure
- Check for repeated visual patterns that could use Card components
