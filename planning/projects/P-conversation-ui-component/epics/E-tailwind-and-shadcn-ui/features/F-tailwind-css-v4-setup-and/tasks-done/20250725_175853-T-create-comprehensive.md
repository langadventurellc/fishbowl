# Create Comprehensive Documentation for Tailwind CSS v4 Setup

## Context

Document the complete Tailwind CSS v4 integration including setup process, architecture decisions, usage patterns, and migration guidelines for future development work.

## Implementation Requirements

### Documentation Structure

Create documentation covering:

- **Setup Summary**: Quick overview of integration approach
- **Architecture**: CSS layer organization and dual system design
- **Usage Patterns**: How to use both CSS variables and Tailwind utilities
- **Migration Guidelines**: Best practices for transitioning from CSS-in-JS
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload, build process, and debugging
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Key Documentation Areas

#### Technical Architecture

- Vite plugin configuration and build integration
- CSS layer structure (theme, base, components, utilities)
- Theme file organization and @theme inline usage
- Dual CSS variable + Tailwind utility system

#### Developer Guidelines

- When to use CSS variables vs Tailwind utilities
- How to add new theme colors and design tokens
- Best practices for component styling during migration
- Dark mode implementation patterns

#### Build and Performance

- Development server configuration and hot reload
- Production build optimization and CSS purging
- Bundle size considerations and monitoring
- Performance testing approaches

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Documentation Completeness

✅ **Setup Instructions**: Clear step-by-step setup process documented  
✅ **Architecture Overview**: CSS layer structure and design decisions explained  
✅ **Usage Examples**: Practical examples of both CSS variables and utilities  
✅ **Migration Guidelines**: Best practices for transitioning components  
✅ **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and resolution steps included

### Developer Experience

✅ **Quick Reference**: Easy-to-find information for common tasks  
✅ **Code Examples**: Working code snippets for typical use cases  
✅ **Best Practices**: Clear guidance on recommended approaches  
✅ **Integration Points**: How Tailwind setup integrates with existing systems

### Technical Accuracy

✅ **Current Information**: Documentation reflects actual implementation  
✅ **Tested Examples**: All code examples verified to work correctly  
✅ **Version Specific**: Tailwind v4 specific features and syntax documented  
✅ **Build Process**: Accurate description of Vite and build integration

## Implementation Approach

### Documentation Format

- Use clear markdown formatting for readability
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting
- Provide visual diagrams for architecture concepts where helpful
- Structure content for both quick reference and detailed learning

### Content Organization

1. **Quick Start**: Immediate setup and basic usage
2. **Architecture Deep Dive**: Technical implementation details
3. **Development Patterns**: Common workflows and best practices
4. **Advanced Topics**: Layer management, performance optimization
5. **Troubleshooting**: Problem resolution and debugging tips

## Security Considerations

### Documentation Security

- **No Sensitive Information**: Ensure no credentials or sensitive data in docs
- **Safe Examples**: All code examples follow security best practices
- **Build Process**: Document secure build and deployment considerations

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: T-add-proper-css-layer (complete implementation)
- **Relationship**: Captures knowledge from all previous implementation tasks

## Success Criteria

- New developers can set up Tailwind CSS v4 using the documentation
- Existing developers understand migration patterns and best practices
- Troubleshooting section addresses common integration issues
- Documentation serves as reference for ongoing development work

## Technical Notes

- Focus on practical guidance rather than theoretical concepts
- Include specific examples from the Fishbowl codebase
- Document both immediate setup and long-term migration strategy
- Provide context for architecture decisions made during implementation

## Content Guidelines

- Write for developers familiar with CSS but new to Tailwind v4
- Include command-line examples with expected output
- Explain the "why" behind architecture decisions
- Keep examples simple but realistic for actual development scenarios

### Log
