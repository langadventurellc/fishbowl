# Migrate AgentPill Component Inline Styles to Tailwind Utilities

## Context

Convert the AgentPill component (`apps/desktop/src/components/chat/AgentPill.tsx`) from CSS-in-JS inline styles to Tailwind utility classes. This component renders agent identification with agent-specific colors, interactive states, and proper accessibility that must maintain precise visual identity and color management.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/chat/AgentPill.tsx` - Agent identification component
- Related agent pill styling and color management files

### Current CSS-in-JS Patterns to Migrate

#### Agent Color System

- Agent-specific background colors based on agent color property
- Text color management for readability against different background colors
- Color opacity and transparency handling for visual hierarchy
- Theme integration for agent colors in light and dark modes

#### Pill Shape and Layout

- Rounded pill appearance with proper border radius
- Padding for comfortable text spacing within pill
- Text centering and alignment within pill container
- Consistent height and sizing across different agent names

#### Interactive States

- Hover state styling if pill is clickable
- Focus state for keyboard navigation accessibility
- Active state for click feedback if interactive
- Disabled state styling if applicable

#### Typography and Content

- Agent name text styling with proper font weight and size
- Text truncation patterns for long agent names
- Icon integration if agent pills include status icons
- Proper spacing between text and any additional elements

### Technical Approach

1. **Analyze Agent Color System**: Study how agent colors are applied and managed
2. **Convert Pill Styling**: Transform rounded pill appearance to Tailwind utilities
3. **Migrate Color Integration**: Handle agent-specific colors with CSS variables or custom utilities
4. **Handle Interactive States**: Convert hover, focus, and active states to Tailwind variants
5. **Preserve Agent Identity**: Maintain exact agent color representation and accessibility

### Specific Migration Patterns

#### Pill Container

- Use `inline-flex items-center justify-center` for pill layout
- Apply `rounded-full` for pill shape
- Add `px-3 py-1` or similar padding for text spacing
- Handle `text-sm` for appropriate text size

#### Agent Color Integration

- Use CSS variables for agent colors: `bg-[var(--agent-color)]` or similar
- Handle text color with dynamic contrast: `text-white` or `text-black` based on background
- Apply color opacity with Tailwind opacity utilities if needed
- Ensure theme integration maintains agent color visibility

#### Interactive States (if applicable)

- Use `hover:opacity-80` for subtle hover feedback
- Apply `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-current` for focus states
- Add `transition-all duration-150` for smooth state changes
- Handle `cursor-pointer` if pill is interactive

#### Typography

- Apply `font-medium` for agent name text
- Use `truncate` for text overflow handling if needed
- Handle `select-none` to prevent text selection if appropriate
- Ensure proper text contrast against agent background colors

### Detailed Acceptance Criteria

#### Visual Parity Requirements

✅ **Pill Shape**: Rounded pill appearance matches original exactly
✅ **Agent Colors**: Agent-specific background colors render identically
✅ **Text Contrast**: Text remains readable against all agent background colors
✅ **Sizing**: Pill dimensions and padding preserved exactly
✅ **Typography**: Agent name text rendering matches original font characteristics

#### Color System Requirements

✅ **Agent Color Accuracy**: Each agent's specific color displays correctly
✅ **Theme Integration**: Agent colors work correctly in light and dark modes
✅ **Color Contrast**: Text contrast meets accessibility standards for all agent colors
✅ **Color Consistency**: Agent colors remain consistent across different usage contexts
✅ **Opacity Handling**: Any opacity or transparency effects work correctly

#### Interaction Requirements (if applicable)

✅ **Hover Feedback**: Hover states provide appropriate visual feedback without compromising colors
✅ **Focus Indicators**: Keyboard focus provides clear indication while preserving agent colors
✅ **Click Feedback**: Active states work correctly if pills are interactive
✅ **State Transitions**: All state changes smooth and properly timed
✅ **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation work correctly

### Dependencies and Integration Points

- **Agent Color System**: Integration with agent color management and CSS variables
- **Theme System**: Full integration with CSS variable theme system maintaining agent colors
- **Typography System**: Agent text must use consistent typography patterns
- **Message System**: Pills must integrate correctly within message headers and layouts
- **Interactive System**: If interactive, must work with click and keyboard event handling

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Testing

- Verify pills render with correct Tailwind classes for each agent
- Test agent-specific colors apply correctly with CSS variables
- Confirm text contrast works correctly against different agent backgrounds
- Validate theme switching maintains agent color visibility

#### Visual Regression Testing

- Screenshot comparison of pills with different agent colors
- Test pill appearance in light and dark modes
- Capture agent color accuracy and text contrast
- Verify pill integration within different parent components

#### Integration Testing

- Test pills work correctly within message headers
- Verify agent color consistency across different usage contexts
- Confirm pills integrate properly with agent labeling systems
- Test pill behavior with various agent name lengths

#### Accessibility Testing

- Verify text contrast meets WCAG standards for all agent colors
- Test screen reader announces agent names correctly
- Confirm keyboard navigation works if pills are interactive
- Validate high contrast mode preserves agent identification

### Performance Considerations

- **Color Rendering**: Agent colors should render efficiently with CSS variables
- **Text Rendering**: Agent name text should render quickly
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced style object creation compared to CSS-in-JS
- **Color Calculations**: Efficient contrast calculation for text colors

### Security Considerations

- **Agent Data**: Agent names do not affect pill styling security
- **Color Safety**: Agent colors do not expose sensitive information
- **XSS Prevention**: All styling through safe Tailwind utilities
- **CSP Compliance**: No inline styles violate Content Security Policy

### Agent Color System Integration

#### CSS Variable Integration

- Agent colors provided through CSS variables for theme compatibility
- Dynamic color application without hardcoded color values
- Proper fallback colors for unknown or undefined agents

#### Contrast Management

- Automatic text color selection based on agent background color
- Maintains readability across all possible agent colors
- Works correctly with both light and dark theme contexts

#### Color Accessibility

- All agent colors meet minimum contrast requirements
- Agent identification remains clear for color-blind users
- High contrast mode compatibility preserved

This task ensures agent identification remains visually distinct and accessible while working seamlessly with the Tailwind utility system and maintaining perfect color fidelity across all theme modes.

### Log
