# Migrate Layout Components Inline Styles to Tailwind Utilities

## Context

Convert the core layout components from CSS-in-JS inline styles to Tailwind utility classes. These components form the fundamental structure of the application including the main conversation layout, content panels, and agent labels container that must maintain precise positioning and responsive behavior.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/layout/ConversationLayoutDisplay.tsx` - Main layout container with sidebar toggle
- `apps/desktop/src/components/layout/MainContentPanelDisplay.tsx` - Central content area layout
- `apps/desktop/src/components/layout/AgentLabelsContainerDisplay.tsx` - Agent pills container layout
- `apps/desktop/src/components/layout/ChatContainerDisplay.tsx` - Chat message container layout

### Current CSS-in-JS Patterns to Migrate

#### Main Layout Structure

- Complex grid/flexbox layout for sidebar, main content, and panel positioning
- Responsive breakpoint handling for different screen sizes
- Z-index management for layered interface elements
- Sidebar toggle positioning with `cursor: pointer` interaction

#### Content Panel Layouts

- Flexible content areas that adapt to available space
- Proper overflow handling for scrollable content areas
- Padding and margin management for content spacing
- Background colors and border styling for visual separation

#### Agent Container Layout

- Horizontal scrollable layout for agent pills
- Proper spacing between agent pills and add button
- Container positioning at top of conversation area
- Alignment and gap management for pill arrangement

### Technical Approach

1. **Analyze Layout Hierarchy**: Study the relationship between layout components and their positioning
2. **Convert Grid/Flexbox Patterns**: Transform complex layout CSS to Tailwind grid and flex utilities
3. **Migrate Responsive Design**: Convert breakpoint-specific styling to Tailwind responsive prefixes
4. **Handle Positioning Logic**: Transform absolute/relative positioning to Tailwind positioning utilities
5. **Preserve Layout Behavior**: Maintain exact layout behavior and visual hierarchy

### Specific Migration Patterns

#### Grid and Flexbox Layout

- Use `grid`, `grid-cols-*`, `grid-rows-*` for complex grid layouts
- Apply `flex`, `flex-col`, `flex-row` for flexible layouts
- Handle spacing with `gap-*`, `space-*` utilities
- Use `flex-1`, `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` for flexible sizing

#### Responsive Design

- Apply responsive prefixes: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` for breakpoint-specific styling
- Use `hidden`, `block` with responsive prefixes for conditional visibility
- Handle responsive spacing and sizing with breakpoint-specific utilities

#### Positioning and Z-Index

- Use `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed` for positioning context
- Apply `top-*`, `right-*`, `bottom-*`, `left-*` for precise positioning
- Handle layering with `z-*` utilities for proper stacking order

#### Overflow and Scrolling

- Use `overflow-*` utilities for content overflow handling
- Apply `scroll-*` utilities for scrollable areas
- Handle content clipping with `overflow-hidden`, `overflow-scroll`

### Detailed Acceptance Criteria

#### Visual Parity Requirements

✅ **Main Layout Structure**: Grid/flexbox layout maintains exact positioning and proportions
✅ **Sidebar Integration**: Sidebar toggle and layout interaction work identically
✅ **Content Panel Sizing**: Main content and side panels maintain correct dimensions
✅ **Agent Container Layout**: Horizontal scrollable agent pills layout preserved
✅ **Responsive Behavior**: Layout adapts correctly at all breakpoints

#### Layout Behavior Requirements

✅ **Sidebar Toggle Functionality**: Sidebar expand/collapse affects layout correctly
✅ **Content Overflow**: Scrollable areas work exactly as before
✅ **Responsive Adaptation**: Layout responds correctly to viewport size changes
✅ **Panel Interactions**: Content panels interact correctly with layout changes
✅ **Theme Integration**: Layout components respond correctly to theme changes

#### Component Integration Requirements

✅ **Child Component Layout**: Child components position correctly within layout containers
✅ **Content Flow**: Text and content flow works correctly with new layout utilities
✅ **Interactive Elements**: Buttons and interactive elements positioned correctly
✅ **Loading States**: Loading indicators and states display correctly within layout
✅ **Error States**: Error displays work correctly with layout constraints

### Dependencies and Integration Points

- **Sidebar Components**: Layout must integrate correctly with migrated sidebar components
- **Chat Components**: Chat container must work with migrated message components
- **Input Components**: Input area must position correctly within layout
- **Theme System**: Full integration with CSS variable theme system
- **Responsive System**: Must work with Tailwind's responsive design system

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Testing

- Verify layout containers render with correct Tailwind grid/flex classes
- Test responsive behavior with different viewport dimensions
- Confirm sidebar toggle affects layout with correct Tailwind utilities
- Validate overflow and scrolling work with Tailwind overflow utilities

#### Visual Regression Testing

- Screenshot comparison of main layout in different states (sidebar open/closed)
- Test layout appearance at all responsive breakpoints
- Capture agent container layout with different numbers of agents
- Verify theme switching affects layout colors and backgrounds correctly

#### Integration Testing

- Test layout works correctly with all child components
- Verify responsive behavior affects all layout elements correctly
- Confirm layout interactions work in full application context
- Test layout performance with large amounts of content

#### Responsive Testing

- Test layout behavior at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- Verify sidebar behavior works correctly on touch devices
- Confirm content overflow handling works across all device sizes
- Test layout accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation

### Performance Considerations

- **Layout Stability**: Layout should not shift during content changes
- **Responsive Performance**: Breakpoint changes should be smooth and immediate
- **Scroll Performance**: Scrollable areas should remain performant with large content
- **Render Efficiency**: Tailwind utilities should improve layout rendering performance

### Security Considerations

- **Content Safety**: Layout constraints do not expose sensitive content areas
- **XSS Prevention**: All layout styling through safe Tailwind utilities
- **CSP Compliance**: No inline styles violate Content Security Policy
- **Layout Isolation**: Layout components properly isolate content areas

This task establishes the fundamental structural foundation for the entire application interface, ensuring all other components have a solid, responsive layout system built with Tailwind utilities.
