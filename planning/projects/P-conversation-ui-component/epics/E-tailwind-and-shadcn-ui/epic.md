# Tailwind and shadcn/ui Integration Epic

## Purpose and Goals

Migrate the component styling system from CSS-in-JS to Tailwind CSS and integrate shadcn/ui components where appropriate, representing Phase 2 of the project. This epic focuses on modernizing the styling approach while maintaining perfect visual parity and component functionality.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### Tailwind CSS Setup and Configuration

- **Build System Integration**: Configure Tailwind CSS in the Vite build pipeline
- **Theme Configuration**: Map existing CSS custom properties to Tailwind theme configuration
- **Design Token Migration**: Convert current design system to Tailwind design tokens
- **PostCSS Setup**: Configure PostCSS for Tailwind processing and optimization

### Component Styling Migration

- **CSS-in-JS to Tailwind**: Convert all existing component styles to Tailwind utility classes
- **Visual Parity Validation**: Ensure pixel-perfect matching throughout migration
- **Responsive Utilities**: Leverage Tailwind responsive utilities for better maintainability
- **Animation Classes**: Convert custom animations to Tailwind animation utilities

### shadcn/ui Component Integration

- **Component Assessment**: Evaluate which components benefit from shadcn/ui replacement
- **Basic Element Replacement**: Replace buttons, inputs, dropdowns with shadcn/ui primitives
- **Theme Integration**: Configure shadcn/ui theming to match existing design system
- **Custom Component Enhancement**: Enhance complex components with shadcn/ui internals where beneficial

### Hybrid Architecture Implementation

- **Component Strategy**: Maintain custom components for complex UI while using shadcn/ui for primitives
- **Consistency Framework**: Ensure design consistency between custom and shadcn/ui components
- **Integration Patterns**: Establish patterns for mixing custom and shadcn/ui components
- **Documentation Updates**: Update component documentation to reflect new implementation approaches

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Tailwind CSS Setup Requirements

✅ **Build Integration**: Tailwind CSS processes correctly in Vite build pipeline

✅ **Performance**: Bundle size equal or smaller than CSS-in-JS implementation  
✅ **Maintainability**: Tailwind classes more maintainable than equivalent CSS-in-JS  
✅ **Responsive Behavior**: All responsive breakpoints work identically to original

### shadcn/ui Integration Requirements

✅ **Component Replacement**: Basic elements (buttons, inputs, dropdowns) replaced with shadcn/ui  
✅ **Theme Consistency**: shadcn/ui components match existing design system  
✅ **Accessibility**: shadcn/ui components maintain or improve accessibility standards  
✅ **Functionality**: All interactive behaviors preserved or enhanced  
✅ **Documentation**: Usage patterns documented for shadcn/ui integrations

### Architecture Requirements

✅ **Hybrid Strategy**: Clear separation between custom and shadcn/ui components  
✅ **Design Consistency**: Unified visual language across component types  
✅ **Integration Patterns**: Documented patterns for combining component types  
✅ **Future Extensibility**: Architecture supports adding more shadcn/ui components

    participant Test as Testing

    CSS->>TW: Convert styles to utilities
    TW->>Test: Validate visual parity
    Test->>SC: Assess component replacement
    SC->>Test: Validate functionality
    Test->>TW: Confirm migration success
```

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want modern CSS utilities so that I can style components more efficiently and consistently.

**As a designer**, I want design system consistency so that all components follow the same visual language regardless of implementation.

**As a maintainer**, I want better developer experience so that styling changes are easier to implement and review.

**As a component consumer**, I want enhanced accessibility so that shadcn/ui components provide better user experience.

**As a team member**, I want clear documentation so that I understand when to use custom vs shadcn/ui components.
