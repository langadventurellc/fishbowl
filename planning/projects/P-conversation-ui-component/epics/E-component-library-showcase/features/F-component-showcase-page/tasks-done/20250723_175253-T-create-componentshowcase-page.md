# Create ComponentShowcase Page

## Context

Create the individual component showcase page accessible via `#/showcase/components`. This page displays individual self-contained components (buttons, inputs, pills, etc.) in organized sections with clear patterns for manual component addition.

## Technical Approach

Build a clean, organized showcase page following existing codebase patterns:

1. **Create organized sections**: Define clear sections for different component types (Input, Conversation, Utility, Display)
2. **Manual addition pattern**: Establish clear patterns for developers to import and add components
3. **Component isolation**: Each component displays with adequate spacing and visual separation
4. **Theme responsiveness**: All elements respond correctly to theme changes from ShowcaseLayout

## Implementation Requirements

### File to Create

- `apps/desktop/src/pages/showcase/ComponentShowcase.tsx`

### Component Structure

```typescript
export function ComponentShowcase() {
  // Organized sections for component types
  // Sample data patterns for when components are added
  // Clear visual separation between components
}
```

### Section Organization

Following the feature specification, organize components into these sections:

1. **Input Components**: Forms, buttons, toggles, input fields, text areas
2. **Conversation Components**: Messages, agent pills, chat interface elements
3. **Utility Components**: Loading states, error boundaries, theme toggles
4. **Display Components**: Cards, lists, modals, tooltips

### Manual Addition Pattern Implementation

Create clear documentation and patterns for developers to add components:

```typescript
// Example pattern developers will follow:
import { SampleComponent } from '../../components/ui/SampleComponent';

const sampleComponentData = {
  sampleProp: 'example value',
  // Additional props as needed per component
};

// Add to appropriate section
<SampleComponent {...sampleComponentData} />
```

### Component Display Framework

1. **Section Headers**: Clear headings for each component category
2. **Component Labels**: Each component should have a descriptive label
3. **Spacing and Layout**: Adequate spacing between components for visual separation
4. **Sample Data Foundation**: Establish patterns for inline sample data objects

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ ComponentShowcase page renders without errors at `#/showcase/components`
- ✅ All component sections are clearly organized and labeled
- ✅ Page integrates correctly with ShowcaseLayout (theme toggle, navigation)
- ✅ Manual addition pattern is documented and easy to follow
- ✅ Visual hierarchy is clear with proper section headings
- ✅ Component isolation shows each component with adequate spacing
- ✅ Theme changes from layout apply correctly to all showcase elements
- ✅ Page loads quickly and integrates with hot reload
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors

## Layout and Visual Requirements

- **Clean, uncluttered design**: Focus attention on individual components
- **Component isolation**: Clear visual separation between showcased components
- **Responsive design**: Adapts appropriately to different window sizes
- **Theme consistency**: Uses existing CSS custom properties system
- **Typography**: Consistent section headings using existing font tokens

## Manual Addition Guidelines

### Component Addition Pattern

```typescript
// 1. Import the component
import { NewComponent } from '../../components/ui/NewComponent';

// 2. Define sample data (inline, typed)
const newComponentData = {
  prop1: 'sample value',
  prop2: true,
  // Type according to component prop interfaces
};

// 3. Add to appropriate section with label
<div className="component-example">
  <h3>NewComponent</h3>
  <NewComponent {...newComponentData} />
</div>
```

### Sample Data Guidelines

- **Per-component basis**: Sample data created as needed when components are added
- **Inline definition**: Simple mock data objects defined directly in showcase file
- **Type safety**: Sample data typed according to component prop interfaces
- **Documentation**: Comments explaining sample data purpose and structure

## Styling Requirements

- **CSS-in-JS approach**: Follow existing patterns from DesignPrototype
- **Theme-aware styling**: All elements respond to light/dark theme changes
- **Visual consistency**: Maintain design language from existing app
- **Clean component display**: Minimal styling that focuses on showcased components

## Testing Requirements

- Manual testing of page loading and rendering
- Verify component sections display correctly
- Test theme toggle functionality affects all page elements
- Verify navigation to/from page works correctly
- Test that sample component addition pattern works as documented

## Dependencies

- Requires ShowcaseLayout component to be completed
- React Router HashRouter setup must be working
- Access to existing CSS custom properties from theme system

## Security Considerations

- No dynamic component loading - all components manually imported for security
- No external data sources or API calls from showcase
- No sensitive data exposure through sample data

## Documentation Requirements

Include clear comments in the file explaining:

- How to add new components to each section
- Sample data patterns and examples
- Section organization rationale

### Log

**2025-07-23T22:52:53.398141Z** - Implemented ComponentShowcase page with organized sections for manual component addition. Complete rewrite using ShowcaseLayout wrapper and CSS custom properties theme system. Added four organized sections (Input, Conversation, Utility, Display) with proper theme integration, responsive grid layout, and comprehensive developer documentation with 3-step component addition pattern. All quality checks (lint, format, type-check) passed successfully.
