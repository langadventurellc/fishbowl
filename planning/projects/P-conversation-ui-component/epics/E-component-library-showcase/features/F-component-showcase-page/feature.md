# Component Showcase Page Feature

## Purpose and Functionality

Create a dual-page showcase system that serves as a visual testing ground for React components during development. This solution provides two distinct showcase experiences: one for individual self-contained components and another for page-level layout demonstration.

## Key Components to Implement

### Dual Showcase Pages

- **ComponentShowcase Page**: Individual component testing page for self-contained components (buttons, inputs, pills, etc.)
- **LayoutShowcase Page**: Full-screen layout demonstration showing how major page components work together (sidebar + main content window)
- **Navigation Integration**: Add both showcase routes to existing React Router setup
- **Shared Navigation**: Easy switching between component and layout showcase views

### Theme Integration

- **Theme Toggle Button**: Reuse existing dark/light theme switching logic from DesignPrototype (shared across both pages)
- **Theme-aware Styling**: Leverage existing CSS custom properties system
- **Theme Persistence**: Maintain theme state across both showcase pages

### Component Display Framework

- **Manual Addition System**: Clear pattern for developers to import and add components to appropriate showcase
- **Component Sections**: Organized sections for individual components (Input, Conversation, Utility, etc.)
- **Layout Demonstration**: Full-screen preview of major layout components working together
- **Sample Data Foundation**: Establish patterns for how sample data will be provided when components are added

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

✅ **Component Showcase Loads**: Page accessible via `/showcase/components` route for individual components  
✅ **Layout Showcase Loads**: Page accessible via `/showcase/layout` route for page-level components  
✅ **Navigation Between Views**: Easy switching between component and layout showcase pages  
✅ **Theme Toggle Works**: Light/dark mode switching functions correctly on both pages using existing theme system  
✅ **Component Sections**: Organized sections ready for manual individual component addition  
✅ **Layout Demonstration**: Full-screen layout showing sidebar + main content integration  
✅ **Manual Addition Pattern**: Clear, documented approach for developers to add components to appropriate showcase  
✅ **Theme Responsiveness**: All showcase elements respond correctly to theme changes  
✅ **Hot Reload Integration**: Both pages work seamlessly with Vite's hot module replacement

### Layout and Visual Requirements

✅ **Clean Component Layout**: Simple, uncluttered design on component showcase that focuses attention on individual components  
✅ **Component Isolation**: Each individual component displays clearly with adequate spacing and visual separation  
✅ **Full-Screen Layout Demo**: Layout showcase demonstrates actual screen layout with sidebar and main content areas  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Both showcase pages adapt appropriately to different window sizes  
✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear section headings and component labeling on component showcase  
✅ **Layout Integration**: Layout showcase shows realistic component integration and interactions  
✅ **Theme Consistency**: Both pages use existing CSS custom properties and maintain design language

### Development Experience Requirements

✅ **Simple Component Addition**: Developers can add components by importing and rendering them  
✅ **Build Integration**: Showcase builds correctly with existing Vite configuration  
✅ **Development Server**: Runs alongside main app development without conflicts  
✅ **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript integration with proper typing  
✅ **Fast Iteration**: Changes to showcased components reflect immediately via hot reload

## Implementation Guidance

### Technical Approach

- **Framework**: Built with React 19.1.0 + TypeScript using existing project setup
- **Routing**: Integrate with existing React Router DOM 7.7.0 configuration
- **Styling**: Use CSS-in-JS approach with existing CSS custom properties system
- **Theme System**: Leverage existing theme implementation from DesignPrototype component

### Architecture Patterns

- **Component Organization**: Follow existing patterns from DesignPrototype for consistent code style
- **State Management**: Use local React state for showcase-specific functionality
- **Theme Integration**: Reuse existing `.dark` class toggle mechanism
- **Hot Reload**: Work within existing Vite HMR configuration

### File Structure

```
apps/desktop/src/
├── pages/
│   └── showcase/
│       ├── ComponentShowcase.tsx     # Individual component testing page
│       ├── LayoutShowcase.tsx        # Page-level layout demonstration
│       └── ShowcaseLayout.tsx        # Shared layout with navigation between showcases
├── components/
│   └── showcase/                     # Shared showcase utilities if needed
└── App.tsx                           # Update routing to include both showcase routes
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Component showcase page loads without console errors at `/showcase/components`
- [ ] Layout showcase page loads without console errors at `/showcase/layout`
- [ ] Navigation between component and layout showcases works correctly
- [ ] Theme toggle switches between light/dark modes correctly on both pages
- [ ] Component sections display with proper headings on component showcase
- [ ] Layout showcase displays full-screen layout with sidebar and main content
- [ ] Hot reload works when making changes to both showcase pages
- [ ] Both pages integrate properly with existing app navigation
- [ ] Sample component addition pattern works as documented for both showcases

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Both showcase routes integrate with existing React Router setup
- [ ] Theme state persists across both showcase pages
- [ ] Theme state management doesn't interfere with main app
- [ ] Build process includes both showcase pages without issues
- [ ] Development server runs both showcases alongside main app

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation

- No dynamic component loading - all components manually imported for security
- Theme toggle limited to predefined light/dark options
- No external data sources or API calls from showcase

### Access Control

- Showcase page accessible in development environment only (if needed)
- No sensitive data exposure through sample data

## Performance Requirements

### Load Time Standards

- **Initial Load**: Showcase page loads within existing app performance standards
- **Theme Switching**: Immediate visual feedback (<100ms) for theme changes
- **Hot Reload**: Component updates reflect within standard Vite HMR times
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal impact on overall app memory footprint

### Resource Constraints

- Reuse existing CSS custom properties to avoid additional style overhead
- Minimize additional bundle size impact
- Leverage existing React Router for navigation efficiency

## Component Addition Guidelines

### Manual Addition Pattern

```typescript
// Example of how developers will add components
import { SampleComponent } from '../components/SampleComponent';

const showcaseData = {
  sampleProp: 'example value',
  // Additional props as needed per component
};

// Add to appropriate section in ShowcasePage
<SampleComponent {...showcaseData} />
```

### Sample Data Approach

- **Per-Component Basis**: Sample data created as needed when components are added
- **Inline Definition**: Simple mock data objects defined directly in showcase file
- **Type Safety**: Sample data typed according to component prop interfaces
- **Documentation**: Comments explaining sample data purpose and structure

### Component Showcase Section Organization

- **Input Components**: Forms, buttons, toggles, input fields, text areas
- **Conversation Components**: Messages, agent pills, chat interface elements
- **Utility Components**: Loading states, error boundaries, theme toggles
- **Display Components**: Cards, lists, modals, tooltips

### Layout Showcase Organization

- **Page-Level Components**: Full-screen demonstration of major layout components
  - **Sidebar Component**: Collapsible navigation and conversation management
  - **Main Content Window**: Primary content area with message display
  - **Layout Integration**: How components work together in realistic screen layout

### Component Addition Guidelines by Showcase Type

#### For Individual Components (ComponentShowcase)

```typescript
// Add to appropriate section in ComponentShowcase.tsx
import { ButtonComponent } from '../components/ui/Button';

const buttonShowcaseData = {
  label: 'Sample Button',
  variant: 'primary',
  onClick: () => console.log('clicked')
};

<ButtonComponent {...buttonShowcaseData} />
```

#### For Layout Components (LayoutShowcase)

```typescript
// Add to LayoutShowcase.tsx for full-screen demonstration
import { Sidebar } from '../components/layout/Sidebar';
import { MainPanel } from '../components/layout/MainPanel';

// Demonstrate realistic integration with sample data
<div className="app-layout">
  <Sidebar {...sidebarProps} />
  <MainPanel {...mainPanelProps} />
</div>
```

This dual-showcase feature establishes comprehensive foundation for both individual component testing and page-level layout validation during development workflow.
