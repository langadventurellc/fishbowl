## Context

The dynamic API management feature requires unique IDs for each API configuration. We need a simple UUID generation utility that can be used when creating new configurations.

## Implementation Requirements

- Create a simple UUID generator function in the llm-setup directory
- The function should generate unique identifiers suitable for React keys
- No external dependencies - use built-in JavaScript capabilities
- The UUID doesn't need to be cryptographically secure, just unique for UI purposes

## Technical Approach

1. Create a new file: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/generateId.ts`
2. Implement a function that generates a UUID-like string using:
   - `crypto.randomUUID()` if available (modern browsers)
   - Fallback to timestamp + random number combination
3. Export the function for use in LlmSetupSection component

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Function generates unique IDs suitable for React keys
- ✓ No external dependencies used
- ✓ Function is exported and can be imported in other components
- ✓ IDs are sufficiently unique for UI purposes (no collisions in normal use)

## Code Quality

- Follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Add JSDoc comments explaining the function's purpose
- Keep implementation simple and focused
