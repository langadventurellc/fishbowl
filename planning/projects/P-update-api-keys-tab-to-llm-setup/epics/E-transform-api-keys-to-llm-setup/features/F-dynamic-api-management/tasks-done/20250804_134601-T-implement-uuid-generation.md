## Context

The dynamic API management feature requires unique IDs for each API configuration. We need a simple UUID generation utility that can be used when creating new configurations.

## Implementation Requirements

- Create a simple UUID generator function in the llm-setup directory
- The function should generate unique identifiers suitable for React keys
- No external dependencies - use built-in JavaScript capabilities
- The UUID doesn't need to be cryptographically secure, just unique for UI purposes

## Technical Approach

1. Create a new file: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/generateId.ts`
2. Implement a function that generates a UUID-like string using:
   - `crypto.randomUUID()` if available (modern browsers)
   - Fallback to timestamp + random number combination
3. Export the function for use in LlmSetupSection component

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Function generates unique IDs suitable for React keys
- ✓ No external dependencies used
- ✓ Function is exported and can be imported in other components
- ✓ IDs are sufficiently unique for UI purposes (no collisions in normal use)

## Code Quality

- Follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Add JSDoc comments explaining the function's purpose
- Keep implementation simple and focused

### Log

**2025-08-04T18:46:01.681400Z** - Implemented UUID generation utility for API configurations using crypto.randomUUID() with fallback to timestamp + random string. The utility follows existing codebase patterns and provides robust unique ID generation for the LLM Setup feature. Function is properly exported through barrel file and integrated into LlmSetupSection component to replace simple timestamp-based ID generation. All quality checks pass successfully.

- filesChanged: ["apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/generateId.ts", "apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/index.ts", "apps/desktop/src/components/settings/LlmSetupSection.tsx"]
