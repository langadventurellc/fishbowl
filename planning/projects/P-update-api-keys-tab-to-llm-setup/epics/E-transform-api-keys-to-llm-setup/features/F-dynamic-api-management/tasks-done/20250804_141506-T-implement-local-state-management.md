## Context

The LlmSetupSection component needs to manage an array of API configurations with full CRUD operations. This is a UI-only implementation with no persistence - configurations exist only in component state.

## Implementation Requirements

- Add state for managing array of API configurations
- Each configuration includes: id, customName, provider, apiKey, baseUrl, useAuthHeader
- Implement add functionality to append new configurations
- Implement update functionality for editing existing configurations
- Implement delete functionality to remove configurations
- Handle transitions between empty state and card list views

## Technical Approach

1. Update `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/LlmSetupSection.tsx`:
   - Add state: `const [configuredApis, setConfiguredApis] = useState<LlmProviderConfig[]>([]);`
   - Define the interface extending LlmConfigData with an id field
2. Update the handleSave function to:
   - Generate UUID for new configurations
   - Update existing configuration if editing
   - Append to array if adding new
3. Add handleEdit function to:
   - Set the editing configuration
   - Open modal with pre-filled data
4. Add handleDelete function to:
   - Filter out the configuration by ID
   - Close any open dialogs
5. Implement conditional rendering:
   - Show EmptyLlmState when array is empty
   - Show list of LlmProviderCards when configurations exist

## State Interface

```typescript
interface LlmProviderConfig extends LlmConfigData {
  id: string;
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ State properly typed with TypeScript interface
- ✓ Add new configuration appends to array with generated UUID
- ✓ Edit updates specific configuration by ID
- ✓ Delete removes configuration from array
- ✓ Empty state shows when no configurations
- ✓ Card list shows when configurations exist
- ✓ Smooth transitions between states
- ✓ No persistence - state exists only during session

## Dependencies

- Requires T-implement-uuid-generation for ID generation

## File Location

- Update: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/LlmSetupSection.tsx`

### Log

**2025-08-04T19:15:06.585521Z** - Implemented comprehensive local state management for API configurations in LlmSetupSection.tsx with full CRUD operations. Added configuredApis state array managing LlmProviderConfig objects with unique IDs generated via generateId() utility. Implemented handleSaveApi for create/update operations, handleEdit for pre-filling edit modal, handleDeleteClick/handleConfirmDelete for removal with confirmation dialog. Added conditional rendering that shows EmptyLlmState when no configs exist and LlmProviderCard list when populated. All state management follows React best practices with immutable updates and proper TypeScript typing. No persistence implemented as per requirements - state exists only during session.
