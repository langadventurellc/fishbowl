## Overview

Final integration of all LLM Setup components and complete removal of old API Keys code. This feature wires together the empty state, modal, and dynamic management functionality while ensuring all old code and references are cleaned up.

## Scope and Deliverables

### 1. Component Integration

- Wire empty state to show/hide based on configurations
- Connect modal save to state management
- Implement proper state flow between components
- Add transitions between states

### 2. Code Cleanup

- Remove old ApiKeysSettings.tsx component
- Remove old ProviderCard.tsx if not reused
- Clean up unused imports and types
- Remove any API Keys related test files

### 3. Polish and Refinement

- Implement smooth transitions
- Add loading states where needed
- Ensure consistent styling
- Verify all acceptance criteria met

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Update any code comments
- Remove references to old components
- Add JSDoc comments to new components

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Component Integration

- ✓ LlmSetupSection shows empty state when no configs
- ✓ LlmSetupSection shows cards when configs exist
- ✓ Empty state button opens modal correctly
- ✓ Modal save adds new configuration
- ✓ Edit button opens modal with correct data
- ✓ Modal save updates existing configuration
- ✓ Delete removes configuration and updates UI
- ✓ Smooth transitions between all states

### State Management Flow

- ✓ Parent component manages all configuration state
- ✓ State changes trigger appropriate UI updates
- ✓ No orphaned state or memory leaks
- ✓ Proper cleanup on component unmount

### Code Cleanup

- ✓ ApiKeysSettings.tsx deleted
- ✓ Old ProviderCard.tsx removed or repurposed
- ✓ No remaining "api-keys" references in code
- ✓ All imports updated and cleaned
- ✓ No unused dependencies
- ✓ Test files updated or removed

### UI Polish

- ✓ 200ms transitions for state changes
- ✓ Consistent spacing throughout
- ✓ Proper focus management
- ✓ No visual glitches or jumps
- ✓ Loading states if needed

### Final Validation

- ✓ All project acceptance criteria met
- ✓ No console errors or warnings
- ✓ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✓ ESLint passes
- ✓ Manual testing confirms all features work

## Implementation Guidance

### Integration Points

```tsx
// LlmSetupSection.tsx
- Manage configurations state
- Conditionally render EmptyLlmState or cards
- Pass callbacks to child components
- Handle all state mutations

// State Flow
Empty State → Click Setup → Modal Opens → Save → Card Added
Card → Click Edit → Modal Opens → Save → Card Updated
Card → Click Delete → Confirm → Card Removed → (Empty State)
```

### Cleanup Checklist

1. Delete `ApiKeysSettings.tsx`
2. Delete old `ProviderCard.tsx` or adapt for new use
3. Search for "api-keys" strings globally
4. Update any remaining test files
5. Remove unused type definitions
6. Clean up imports in all files

### Transition Implementation

- Use CSS transitions for smooth effects
- Consider framer-motion if complex animations needed
- Ensure no layout shift during transitions
- Test on various screen sizes

## Testing Requirements

### Comprehensive Testing

- Full user flow from empty to configured
- Add multiple configurations
- Edit each configuration type
- Delete all configurations
- Verify empty state returns
- Test all keyboard shortcuts
- Test modal stacking behavior

### Code Quality Validation

- Run `pnpm quality` and fix all issues
- No TypeScript errors
- No ESLint warnings
- All tests pass or are updated
- Build completes successfully

### Cross-browser Testing

- Test in Electron environment
- Verify modal behavior
- Check transitions and animations
- Ensure consistent appearance

## Security Considerations

- Verify no API keys logged during cleanup
- Ensure sensitive data properly handled
- No leftover debug code

## Performance Requirements

- App remains responsive during transitions
- No memory leaks from old code
- Efficient re-renders
- Quick state updates
