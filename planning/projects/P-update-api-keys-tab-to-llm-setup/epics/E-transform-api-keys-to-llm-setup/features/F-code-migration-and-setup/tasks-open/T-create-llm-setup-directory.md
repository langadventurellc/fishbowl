## Context

This task establishes the directory structure for the new LLM Setup components. Creating this structure early allows parallel development of components and maintains organization from the start.

**Related Feature**: F-code-migration-and-setup
**Directory Location**: `/Users/zach/code/fishbowl/apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/`
**Pattern Reference**: Similar to existing subdirectories like `agents/`, `personalities/`, and `roles/`

## Implementation Requirements

Create the directory structure and initial barrel export file:

1. Create the `llm-setup` directory
2. Create an `index.ts` file for barrel exports
3. Add placeholder exports for future components

## Technical Approach

1. Create directory `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/`
2. Create file `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/index.ts`
3. Add initial exports with TODO comments for future components
4. Follow the barrel export pattern used in other settings subdirectories

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ Directory `llm-setup` created in the correct location
- ✓ File `index.ts` created with proper TypeScript syntax
- ✓ Barrel export file includes TODO comments for future components
- ✓ File structure matches other settings subdirectories
- ✓ No linting errors in the index file

## Implementation Code

Create `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/index.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * Barrel exports for LLM Setup components.
 *
 * This module will contain all components related to LLM provider
 * configuration including empty states, modals, and provider cards.
 */

// TODO: Export EmptyLlmState when implemented
// export { EmptyLlmState } from "./EmptyLlmState";

// TODO: Export LlmConfigModal when implemented
// export { LlmConfigModal } from "./LlmConfigModal";

// TODO: Export LlmProviderCard when implemented
// export { LlmProviderCard } from "./LlmProviderCard";

// Temporary export to satisfy module requirements
export {};
```

## Testing Requirements

After creating the structure:

1. Verify the directory exists at the correct path
2. Run `pnpm lint` to ensure the index file has no issues
3. Confirm the file structure matches other subdirectories
4. The empty export should prevent "no exports" warnings

## Dependencies

This task has no prerequisites and can be completed independently. It provides the foundation for future component development.

## Directory Structure Example

After completion:

```
apps/desktop/src/components/settings/
├── agents/
├── personalities/
├── roles/
├── llm-setup/          <-- New directory
│   └── index.ts        <-- Barrel export file
├── LlmSetupSection.tsx
└── ... other files
```

## Future Development

This directory will eventually contain:

- `EmptyLlmState.tsx` - Empty state component
- `LlmConfigModal.tsx` - Configuration modal
- `LlmProviderCard.tsx` - Provider display cards
- Additional utility components as needed

## Security Considerations

No security implications - this creates empty directory structure only.
