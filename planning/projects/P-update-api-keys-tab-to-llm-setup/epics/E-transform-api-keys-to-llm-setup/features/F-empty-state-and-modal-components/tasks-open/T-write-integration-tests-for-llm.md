## Context

Create comprehensive integration tests that verify the complete user flow from empty state through modal configuration. These tests ensure all components work together correctly.

## Technical Approach

1. Create test file at `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/__tests__/LlmSetupSection.test.tsx`
2. Test complete user flows and component interactions
3. Verify accessibility and keyboard navigation
4. Test modal stacking behavior

## Test Scenarios

### Empty State Flow:

1. Component renders with empty state
2. User selects provider from dropdown
3. User clicks setup button
4. Modal opens with correct provider
5. User fills form and saves
6. Modal closes and state updates

### Modal Interaction Flow:

1. Modal opens on top of settings modal
2. All form fields are interactive
3. Keyboard shortcuts work (Escape, Ctrl/Cmd+S)
4. Focus management works correctly
5. Accessibility attributes are present

### Edge Cases:

- Modal cancel doesn't affect state
- Provider selection persists to modal
- Multiple open/close cycles work
- Component unmounting cleans up properly

## Implementation Details

### Test Structure:

```tsx
describe("LlmSetupSection Integration", () => {
  describe("Empty State to Configuration Flow", () => {
    // Test complete user journey
  });

  describe("Modal Stacking Behavior", () => {
    // Test modal on modal interactions
  });

  describe("Keyboard Navigation", () => {
    // Test all keyboard shortcuts
  });

  describe("Accessibility", () => {
    // Test ARIA attributes and screen reader flow
  });
});
```

### Testing Tools:

- Use React Testing Library
- Mock Dialog/Portal components if needed
- Test keyboard events with fireEvent
- Verify focus with document.activeElement

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tests cover complete user flow from empty to configured
- [ ] Modal stacking behavior is verified
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts are tested
- [ ] Focus management is tested
- [ ] Accessibility attributes are verified
- [ ] Form interactions are tested
- [ ] State transitions are verified
- [ ] Tests are maintainable and well-documented
- [ ] All tests pass reliably
- [ ] Coverage meets project standards

## Testing Requirements

Integration tests should verify:

- Complete user flows work end-to-end
- Components integrate correctly
- State management works as expected
- No memory leaks or cleanup issues
- Performance is acceptable

## Dependencies

This task depends on T-create-llmsetupsection-component being completed first to have all components ready for integration testing.
