# Roles Section Implementation

## Purpose

Implement the complete Roles settings section with two functional tabs (Predefined, Custom) featuring a 2-column grid of predefined role cards and a management interface for custom roles with create, edit, and delete functionality.

## Key Components to Implement

### Predefined Tab

- 2-column grid layout of role cards with consistent sizing
- Role cards displaying icons (üìä, üíº, etc.), names, and descriptions
- "View Details" hover states (styled but non-functional as specified)
- Non-editable visual indicators for predefined roles
- Responsive grid behavior for different screen sizes

### Custom Tab

- List layout of custom roles with name and description preview
- Edit and Delete buttons for each custom role
- "+ Create Custom Role" button with primary styling
- Empty state handling for no custom roles
- Role creation modal or inline form
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Predefined Tab Implementation

- [ ] 2-column grid layout for role cards (responsive to 1 column on mobile)
- [ ] Each card shows: role icon (üìä, üíº, üé®, üìà, üî¨, ü§ù), name, brief description
- [ ] "View Details" hover state with visual feedback (non-functional but styled)
- [ ] Cards are visually non-editable with proper indicators
- [ ] Consistent card sizing and spacing (16px gaps)
- [ ] Proper hover states with subtle elevation changes
- [ ] Icons use consistent styling and sizing
- [ ] Responsive behavior: 2 cols desktop, 1 col mobile

### Custom Tab Implementation

- [ ] List layout of custom roles with clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] Each item shows: role name, description preview (truncated)
- [ ] Edit and Delete buttons positioned consistently (right-aligned)
- [ ] "+ Create Custom Role" button with primary styling and proper spacing
- [ ] Empty state: "No custom roles created. Create your first custom role!"
- [ ] Role creation form with name and description fields
- [ ] Confirmation dialog for role deletion
- [ ] Loading states for CRUD operations

### Role Management Features

- [ ] Role creation form with validation
- [ ] Name field with character limits and validation
- [ ] Description field (textarea) with character count
- [ ] Form validation with helpful error messages
- [ ] Success feedback after role creation/editing
- [ ] Error handling for failed operations
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates for better UX

### Integration Requirements

- [ ] Uses Interactive Tab System Foundation for tab navigation
- [ ] Integrates with Zustand store for custom role management
- [ ] Consistent styling with other settings sections
- [ ] Responsive behavior across all screen sizes
- [ ] Proper accessibility attributes throughout

## Implementation Guidance

### Component Architecture

```typescript
interface PredefinedRole {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  category?: string;
}

interface CustomRole {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

interface RoleFormData {
  name: string;
  description: string;
}
```

### Predefined Roles Data

- Developer: üìä "Specializes in software development and technical problem-solving"
- Designer: üé® "Focuses on user experience and visual design solutions"
- Writer: ‚úçÔ∏è "Expert in content creation and communication"
- Analyst: üìà "Data-driven insights and analytical thinking"
- Researcher: üî¨ "Information gathering and evidence-based conclusions"
- Assistant: ü§ù "General support and task coordination"

### Grid Layout Implementation

- Use CSS Grid for responsive 2-column layout
- Equal-height cards with flex layout
- Proper spacing using Tailwind gap utilities
- Mobile breakpoint at 640px (sm:)
- Consistent card aspect ratios

### Custom Role Management

- Modal dialog for role creation/editing
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Character limits: name (50 chars), description (200 chars)
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Optimistic updates with rollback on error

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing

- Grid layout responds correctly to screen size changes
- Custom role CRUD operations work reliably
- Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- Tab switching preserves any unsaved form state
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions

### User Experience Testing

- Grid layout looks balanced and professional
- Custom role list is easy to scan and manage
- Role creation flow is intuitive and efficient
- Empty states guide users effectively
- Loading states don't block other interactions

### Accessibility Testing

- Grid cards are keyboard navigable
- Form controls are properly labeled
- Confirmation dialogs are accessible
- Screen readers can navigate role lists
- Focus management works correctly

## Security Considerations

- Input validation for role names and descriptions
- Sanitization of user-provided content
- Proper handling of role deletion operations
- Protection against XSS in role content
- Validation of role ID references

## Performance Requirements

- Grid rendering optimized for 20+ predefined roles
- Custom role list handles 100+ items efficiently
- Form interactions feel immediate (< 50ms)
- Tab switching maintains smooth 200ms transitions
- CRUD operations provide immediate feedback

## Dependencies

- Requires: F-interactive-tab-system (Interactive Tab System Foundation)
- Requires: shadcn/ui Card, Dialog, Form components
- Requires: Lucide React icons for role representation
- Integrates: Zustand store for custom role management

## Estimated Tasks: 10-14 tasks (1-2 hours each)
