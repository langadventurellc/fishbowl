# Create PredefinedTab Component with Responsive 2-Column Grid

## Context

Implement the Predefined tab component that displays all predefined roles in a responsive 2-column grid layout. This tab shows read-only role cards with consistent spacing and professional presentation.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Create PredefinedTab Component

**File: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/PredefinedTab.tsx`**

Implement tab content component:

```tsx
interface PredefinedTabProps {
  className?: string;
}

export const PredefinedTab = ({ className }: PredefinedTabProps) => {
  return (
    <div className={cn("predefined-tab", className)}>
      <div className="roles-grid">
        {PREDEFINED_ROLES.map((role) => (
          <PredefinedRoleCard
            key={role.id}
            role={role}
            className="role-card-item"
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 2. Implement Responsive Grid Layout

**CSS Grid configuration:**

- Desktop (≥640px): 2-column grid with 16px gaps
- Mobile (<640px): 1-column layout
- Equal-height cards using CSS Grid properties
- Proper spacing and alignment at all screen sizes

### 3. Add Loading and Error States

**State handling:**

- Loading skeleton for initial render (if needed)
- Error boundary for failed role data loading
- Graceful fallback if predefined roles data unavailable
- Empty state (though unlikely with static data)

### 4. Optimize Performance

**Performance considerations:**

- Memoize component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Virtual scrolling if role count becomes very large (future-proofing)
- Lazy loading for role card images/icons if applicable
- Efficient key prop usage for React reconciliation

### 5. Add Accessibility Features

**Accessibility requirements:**

- Proper heading hierarchy for screen readers
- Grid navigation with arrow keys
- ARIA labels for role grid context
- Focus management within grid layout
- High contrast support for visual elements

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Grid Layout

- [ ] 2-column grid displays consistently on desktop screens (≥640px)
- [ ] 1-column layout on mobile screens (<640px) maintains readability
- [ ] 16px gaps between cards maintained at all screen sizes
- [ ] Cards have equal heights within each row using CSS Grid
- [ ] Grid maintains proper alignment and spacing with different content lengths

### Responsive Behavior

- [ ] Smooth transition between column layouts at breakpoint (640px)
- [ ] Grid container maintains proper margins and padding
- [ ] Cards remain readable and well-proportioned at all screen sizes
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on narrow screens
- [ ] Grid adapts gracefully to very wide screens (max-width constraints)

### Card Integration

- [ ] All predefined roles render correctly within grid
- [ ] Role cards maintain consistent appearance and behavior
- [ ] Hover states work properly for all cards in grid
- [ ] Card focus indicators work correctly with keyboard navigation
- [ ] No layout shift when cards load or change state

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Component renders efficiently with all predefined roles
- [ ] Re-renders only when necessary (proper memoization)
- [ ] Grid layout performance remains smooth during window resizing
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable with static role data
- [ ] Initial load time is minimal for grid rendering

### Accessibility

- [ ] Screen readers can navigate grid structure properly
- [ ] Grid has appropriate ARIA labels and structure
- [ ] Keyboard navigation flows logically through role cards
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible throughout grid
- [ ] High contrast mode preserves grid readability

### Error Handling

- [ ] Component handles missing or malformed role data gracefully
- [ ] Error boundary prevents tab crashes from invalid data
- [ ] Fallback content displays when role data unavailable
- [ ] User feedback provided for any data loading issues
- [ ] Component recovers properly when data becomes available

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for component rendering with predefined roles data
- [ ] Responsive behavior tests at different screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility tests with axe-core integration
- [ ] Performance tests for grid rendering with full role set
- [ ] Error handling tests with invalid or missing data

## Implementation Notes

- Use CSS Grid for layout (not flexbox) for equal-height card behavior
- Follow existing responsive patterns from other grid components
- Use Tailwind CSS grid utilities for responsive breakpoints
- Consider using CSS custom properties for consistent spacing

## Dependencies

- Requires: T-create-predefinedrolecard (PredefinedRoleCard component)
- Requires: T-create-predefined-roles-data-and (PREDEFINED_ROLES data)

## Security Considerations

- Static predefined data has minimal security concerns
- Ensure role data rendering doesn't introduce XSS vulnerabilities
- Validate props to prevent runtime errors from malformed data
