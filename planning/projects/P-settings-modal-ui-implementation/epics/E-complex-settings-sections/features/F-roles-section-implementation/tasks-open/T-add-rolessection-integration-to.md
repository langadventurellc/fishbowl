# Add RolesSection Integration to SettingsContent Component

## Context

Integrate the completed RolesSection component into the existing SettingsContent component to make it accessible through the settings modal navigation. This requires updating the settings section configuration and ensuring proper integration with the existing navigation system.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Update SettingsContent Component

**File: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsContent.tsx`**

Add RolesSection to the settings section mapping:

```typescript
// Import the new RolesSection component
import { RolesSection } from './RolesSection';

// Update the RolesSettings component to use RolesSection
const RolesSettings = () => (
  <div className="roles-settings">
    <div className="section-header">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Roles</h1>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
        Define and configure agent roles and permissions.
      </p>
    </div>
    <RolesSection />
  </div>
);

// Ensure RolesSettings is included in the SETTINGS_SECTIONS mapping
const SETTINGS_SECTIONS = {
  general: GeneralSettings,
  apiKeys: ApiKeysSettings,
  appearance: AppearanceSettings,
  agents: AgentsSettings,
  personalities: PersonalitiesSettings,
  roles: RolesSettings, // This should already exist but ensure it uses new component
  advanced: AdvancedSettings,
} as const;
```

### 2. Verify Navigation Configuration

**File: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsNavigation.tsx`**

Ensure roles navigation item is properly configured:

```typescript
{
  id: "roles" as const,
  label: "Roles",
  hasSubTabs: true,
  subTabs: [
    { id: "predefined", label: "Predefined" },
    { id: "custom", label: "Custom" }
  ],
}
```

### 3. Update Settings Modal Description

**File: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsModal.tsx`**

Ensure roles are mentioned in the modal description:

```typescript
description =
  "Configure application settings including general preferences, API keys, appearance, agents, personalities, roles, and advanced options.";
```

### 4. Add Integration Tests

**File: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/__tests__/SettingsIntegration.test.tsx`**

Create integration tests to verify:

- RolesSection renders when roles navigation item is selected
- Tab navigation works correctly within roles section
- Settings modal can navigate to roles section
- Roles section maintains state during navigation

### 5. Update Accessibility Descriptions

**File: `apps/desktop/src/utils/getAccessibleDescription.ts`**

Ensure roles section has proper accessibility description:

```typescript
const sectionDescriptions = {
  // ... other sections
  roles: "Set up agent roles and their specific responsibilities",
  // ... other sections
};
```

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Component Integration

- [ ] RolesSection renders correctly when roles navigation item is selected
- [ ] Section header displays "Roles" title and appropriate description
- [ ] Component maintains consistent styling with other settings sections
- [ ] Tab container integrates properly with existing navigation system
- [ ] No layout issues or visual inconsistencies with other sections

### Navigation Behavior

- [ ] Clicking "Roles" in settings navigation displays roles section
- [ ] Sub-tab navigation (Predefined/Custom) works correctly
- [ ] Active tab state persists when navigating away and back to roles
- [ ] Navigation breadcrumb or indicators show correct location
- [ ] Back button or navigation maintains proper state

### Settings Modal Integration

- [ ] Modal description accurately reflects roles functionality
- [ ] Modal width and height accommodate roles section content
- [ ] Scrolling behavior works correctly with roles content
- [ ] Modal keyboard shortcuts work within roles section
- [ ] Modal closing preserves any unsaved role changes appropriately

### State Management

- [ ] Roles section state integrates with settings modal state
- [ ] Custom roles persist across settings modal sessions
- [ ] Tab state managed correctly through navigation store
- [ ] Modal operations don't interfere with other settings sections
- [ ] Store subscriptions properly cleaned up when navigating away

### Responsive Integration

- [ ] Roles section adapts correctly to settings modal responsive behavior
- [ ] Mobile navigation to roles section works properly
- [ ] Narrow screen behavior maintains usability
- [ ] Touch interactions work throughout roles interface
- [ ] Content scrolling works correctly within modal constraints

### Accessibility Integration

- [ ] Screen readers announce navigation to roles section correctly
- [ ] ARIA landmarks and headings maintain proper hierarchy
- [ ] Focus management works when navigating to/from roles section
- [ ] Keyboard navigation flows correctly through roles interface
- [ ] High contrast mode preserves all roles section functionality

### Performance Integration

- [ ] Roles section loads efficiently when first accessed
- [ ] Navigation between sections remains smooth
- [ ] Large numbers of custom roles don't affect modal performance
- [ ] Component unmounting/mounting performs efficiently
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended settings use

### Error Handling Integration

- [ ] Roles section errors don't crash entire settings modal
- [ ] Error boundaries properly contain roles-specific failures
- [ ] Network errors in roles section display appropriate feedback
- [ ] Settings modal remains functional if roles section fails
- [ ] Error recovery allows continued use of other settings sections

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Integration tests verify complete navigation workflow
- [ ] Tests ensure roles section renders in correct modal context
- [ ] Accessibility tests cover full settings modal integration
- [ ] Performance tests include roles section in modal testing
- [ ] Error handling tests verify proper isolation and recovery

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing patterns from PersonalitiesSection integration
- Ensure import paths are correct for the new RolesSection component
- **IMPORTANT: Import types from shared package using `@fishbowl-ai/shared`**
- All component props interfaces should already exist in shared package
- Test integration thoroughly before completing task
- Consider any build or bundling implications of new components
- Run `pnpm build:libs` if shared types are updated during implementation

## Dependencies

- Requires: T-create-main-rolessection (completed RolesSection component)

## Security Considerations

- Ensure roles section doesn't expose sensitive information in modal context
- Validate that navigation state changes don't create security vulnerabilities
- Test that modal closing properly cleans up any sensitive role data
- Verify error handling doesn't leak internal application state
