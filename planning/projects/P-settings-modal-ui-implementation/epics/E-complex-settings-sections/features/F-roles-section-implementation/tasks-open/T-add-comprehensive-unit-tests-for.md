# Add Comprehensive Unit Tests for All Role Components

## Context

Create comprehensive unit test suites for all role-related components to ensure functionality, accessibility, and integration work correctly. Tests should cover component rendering, user interactions, store integration, and edge cases.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Test Shared Package Components

**Test files in `packages/shared/src/__tests__/`:**

**Role Types and Validation:**

- `types/settings/Role.test.ts` - Test type definitions and interfaces
- `schemas/roleSchema.test.ts` - Test Zod validation schema with edge cases
- `stores/customRolesStore.test.ts` - Test store CRUD operations and state management
- `utils/roleUtils.test.ts` - Test utility functions for role operations

### 2. Test Desktop Components

**Test files in `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/__tests__/`:**

**Component Tests:**

- `PredefinedRoleCard.test.tsx` - Card rendering and hover interactions
- `CustomRoleListItem.test.tsx` - List item display and action buttons
- `CreateRoleForm.test.tsx` - Form validation and submission
- `PredefinedTab.test.tsx` - Grid layout and responsive behavior
- `CustomTab.test.tsx` - List display and empty states
- `RoleDeleteDialog.test.tsx` - Confirmation dialog behavior
- `RoleFormModal.test.tsx` - Modal state and form integration
- `RolesSection.test.tsx` - Main component integration and CRUD workflows

### 3. Create Test Utilities and Mocks

**Test helpers:**

```typescript
// Test utilities for role testing
export const createMockRole = (
  overrides?: Partial<CustomRole>,
): CustomRole => ({
  id: "test-role-id",
  name: "Test Role",
  description: "Test role description",
  createdAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  updatedAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  ...overrides,
});

export const createMockPredefinedRole = (
  overrides?: Partial<PredefinedRole>,
): PredefinedRole => ({
  id: "technical-advisor",
  name: "Technical Advisor",
  description: "Provide technical expertise",
  icon: "ðŸ“Š",
  category: "technical",
  ...overrides,
});
```

### 4. Add Integration Tests

**Integration test scenarios:**

- Complete CRUD workflow from RolesSection
- Tab switching with state preservation
- Form submission with store updates
- Error handling across component boundaries
- Modal coordination and state management

### 5. Add Accessibility Tests

**Accessibility testing:**

- Screen reader compatibility for all components
- Keyboard navigation through role interfaces
- Focus management in modals and dialogs
- ARIA labels and roles for complex interactions
- Color contrast and visual indicator testing

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Shared Package Tests

- [ ] Role schema validation tests cover all validation rules and edge cases
- [ ] Custom roles store tests achieve 95%+ code coverage
- [ ] Store tests cover CRUD operations, error handling, and state management
- [ ] Utility function tests cover all helper functions with edge cases
- [ ] Type tests ensure proper TypeScript inference and interfaces

### Component Rendering Tests

- [ ] All role components render correctly with valid props
- [ ] Components handle missing or invalid props gracefully
- [ ] Empty states display appropriate messages and actions
- [ ] Loading states show proper feedback during operations
- [ ] Error states display clear error messages with recovery options

### User Interaction Tests

- [ ] Button clicks trigger correct callback functions
- [ ] Form submission validates data and calls appropriate handlers
- [ ] Modal operations (open/close) work correctly with state management
- [ ] Tab switching preserves component state appropriately
- [ ] Keyboard interactions work for all interactive elements

### Store Integration Tests

- [ ] Components re-render correctly when store state changes
- [ ] CRUD operations update UI state appropriately
- [ ] Error states from store display in component UI
- [ ] Loading states from store disable UI appropriately
- [ ] Optimistic updates provide immediate feedback

### Form Validation Tests

- [ ] Real-time validation works for all form fields
- [ ] Character limits enforced with proper feedback
- [ ] Unique name validation prevents duplicate roles
- [ ] Form submission blocked with invalid data
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable

### Responsive Design Tests

- [ ] Grid layouts adapt correctly to different screen sizes
- [ ] Components remain usable on mobile devices
- [ ] Text truncation works properly at narrow widths
- [ ] Touch interactions function correctly on mobile
- [ ] Accessibility maintained across all screen sizes

### Accessibility Tests

- [ ] All components pass axe-core accessibility audits
- [ ] Screen readers announce content changes correctly
- [ ] Keyboard navigation follows logical tab order
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and consistent
- [ ] ARIA labels provide appropriate context

### Performance Tests

- [ ] Components render efficiently with large datasets
- [ ] Re-renders minimized through proper memoization
- [ ] List components handle 100+ items without performance issues
- [ ] Modal operations don't block other UI interactions
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during testing

### Error Handling Tests

- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully with user feedback
- [ ] Component crashes prevented with proper error boundaries
- [ ] Invalid data doesn't break component rendering
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms work after error states
- [ ] Error messages provide specific, actionable information

## Testing Requirements

### Coverage Targets

- [ ] Unit test coverage â‰¥90% for all role components
- [ ] Integration test coverage for all CRUD workflows
- [ ] Accessibility test coverage for all interactive elements
- [ ] Error handling test coverage for all failure scenarios

### Test Organization

- [ ] Tests organized logically with clear naming conventions
- [ ] Test utilities shared appropriately to avoid duplication
- [ ] Mock data realistic and representative of actual use
- [ ] Test setup and teardown handle store state properly

### Continuous Integration

- [ ] All tests run automatically in CI pipeline
- [ ] Test failures block deployment appropriately
- [ ] Performance regression tests catch slowdowns
- [ ] Accessibility tests run with each PR

## Implementation Notes

- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Jest for unit tests and mocking
- Use axe-core for accessibility testing
- Follow existing test patterns from personality components
- Create comprehensive mock data for consistent testing

## Dependencies

- Requires: T-create-main-rolessection (all role components completed)

## Security Considerations

- Test input validation thoroughly to prevent XSS
- Ensure tests don't expose sensitive data in logs
- Validate that error handling doesn't leak internal information
- Test authorization and permission checks if applicable
