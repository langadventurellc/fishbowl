# Integrate Personalities Section with Interactive Tab System

## Context

Integrate the complete Personalities section (Saved and Create New tabs) with the Interactive Tab System Foundation, ensuring seamless navigation, proper state management, and consistent user experience within the broader settings modal.

## Implementation Requirements

### Tab System Integration

Create `PersonalitiesSection.tsx` as main container component:

```typescript
interface PersonalitiesSectionProps {
  // Integration props from settings modal
  isActive: boolean;
  onNavigateAway?: () => Promise<boolean>; // Unsaved changes check
}

const PersonalitiesSection: React.FC<PersonalitiesSectionProps> = ({
  isActive,
  onNavigateAway
}) => {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'saved' | 'create'>('saved');

  return (
    <TabSystem
      tabs={[
        {
          id: 'saved',
          label: 'Saved',
          content: <SavedPersonalitiesTab onEdit={handleEdit} onClone={handleClone} />
        },
        {
          id: 'create',
          label: 'Create New',
          content: <CreatePersonalityForm onSave={handleSave} onCancel={handleCancel} />
        }
      ]}
      activeTab={activeTab}
      onTabChange={handleTabChange}
    />
  );
};
```

### Tab Navigation Logic

Implement comprehensive tab switching with state preservation:

**Tab Change Handler**

```typescript
const handleTabChange = async (newTabId: string) => {
  // Check for unsaved changes in Create New tab
  if (activeTab === "create" && hasUnsavedChanges()) {
    const shouldSwitch = await confirmUnsavedChanges();
    if (!shouldSwitch) return;
  }

  // Update active tab
  setActiveTab(newTabId as "saved" | "create");

  // Update URL/navigation state if needed
  updateNavigationState(newTabId);
};
```

**Edit/Clone Navigation**

- Edit button: Switch to Create New tab with pre-filled form
- Clone button: Switch to Create New tab with duplicated data
- Save success: Switch back to Saved tab
- Cancel action: Return to previous tab or Saved tab

### State Management Integration

Connect with broader settings modal state:

**Personalities Section State**

```typescript
interface PersonalitiesSectionState {
  activeTab: "saved" | "create";
  editingPersonality: Personality | null;
  hasUnsavedChanges: boolean;
  lastViewedTab: "saved" | "create";
}
```

**Settings Modal Integration**

- Register personalities section with settings modal
- Handle section activation/deactivation
- Integrate with modal navigation breadcrumbs
- Support direct deep-linking to personality tabs

### Unsaved Changes Handling

Implement comprehensive unsaved changes protection:

**Detection Logic**

- Monitor form state changes in Create New tab
- Track when user starts editing personality data
- Compare current form state with initial/saved state
- Reset unsaved state after successful save

**User Confirmation Flow**

```typescript
const confirmUnsavedChanges = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    showConfirmDialog({
      title: "Unsaved Changes",
      message: "You have unsaved changes. Do you want to discard them?",
      confirmText: "Discard Changes",
      cancelText: "Keep Editing",
      onConfirm: () => resolve(true),
      onCancel: () => resolve(false),
    });
  });
};
```

### Responsive Tab Behavior

Ensure tabs work across all device sizes:

- **Desktop**: Full horizontal tab layout
- **Tablet**: Compact tab layout with proper spacing
- **Mobile**: Stack tabs vertically or use dropdown
- **Touch targets**: Appropriate size for touch interaction

### Accessibility Integration

- **Tab navigation**: Proper ARIA labels and roles
- **Keyboard navigation**: Tab key navigation between sections
- **Screen reader support**: Announce tab changes and content
- **Focus management**: Maintain focus within active tab
- **Navigation announcements**: Clearly announce section changes

### Settings Modal Integration Points

Connect with existing settings infrastructure:

**Navigation Integration**

- Register personalities section in settings navigation
- Handle breadcrumb updates for deep navigation
- Support back/forward navigation within settings
- Integrate with settings search functionality (optional)

**Theme and Styling**

- Use consistent styling with other settings sections
- Apply settings modal theme/branding
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Follow established component patterns

**State Persistence**

- Remember last active tab across modal sessions
- Preserve form drafts when modal closes/reopens
- Integrate with settings modal state management
- Handle modal close/reopen gracefully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Personalities section integrates seamlessly with Interactive Tab System
- [ ] Tab navigation between Saved and Create New works smoothly
- [ ] Edit/Clone functionality properly switches tabs with data pre-filling
- [ ] Unsaved changes protection prevents accidental data loss
- [ ] Save success navigates back to Saved tab automatically
- [ ] Section integrates with broader settings modal navigation
- [ ] Responsive behavior works across all device sizes
- [ ] Accessibility features work for all tab interactions
- [ ] State management preserves tab and form state appropriately
- [ ] Tab transitions maintain 200ms animation consistency

## Testing Requirements

- Integration tests for tab system connectivity
- Test tab navigation with various state scenarios
- Verify unsaved changes protection across navigation paths
- Test edit/clone tab switching with data preservation
- Accessibility testing for tab navigation and announcements
- Responsive testing across different screen sizes
- State persistence testing across modal close/reopen
- Performance testing for smooth tab transitions

## Dependencies

- Interactive Tab System Foundation (F-interactive-tab-system)
- SavedPersonalitiesTab from T-implement-saved-personalities
- CreatePersonalityForm from T-create-comprehensive-personality
- Settings modal navigation infrastructure
- Confirmation dialog components
- State management utilities

## Security Considerations

- Validate tab switching permissions
- Secure handling of personality data during navigation
- Protect against malicious tab manipulation
- Ensure proper data isolation between tabs

## Performance Requirements

- Tab switching completes within 200ms for smooth UX
- No performance degradation with large personality collections
- Efficient state management during tab navigation
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Minimal re-renders during tab changes
