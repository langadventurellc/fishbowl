# Implement Saved Personalities Grid Layout with Empty States

## Context

Create the Saved tab content that displays personality cards in a responsive grid layout with proper empty state handling and loading states for the Personalities section.

## Implementation Requirements

### Grid Layout Structure

Create `SavedPersonalitiesTab.tsx` component:

- Responsive grid: 1 column (mobile), 2 columns (tablet), 3 columns (desktop)
- 16px gap between cards as specified
- Proper container padding and margins
- Scroll behavior for large collections

### Empty State Implementation

When no personalities are saved:

- Centered empty state message: "No personalities saved. Create your first personality!"
- Optional illustration or icon
- Call-to-action button linking to Create New tab
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy

### Loading States

- Skeleton cards during data fetching
- Loading spinner for initial load
- Smooth transition from loading to content
- Error state handling for failed loads

### Grid Responsive Behavior

```css
/* Example grid structure */
.personalities-grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 16px;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* mobile */
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .personalities-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* tablet */
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .personalities-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* desktop */
  }
}
```

### State Management Integration

- Connect to Zustand store for personalities list
- Handle personality deletion with confirmation
- Trigger edit/clone actions from cards
- Real-time updates when personalities change

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Responsive grid adapts: 1-2-3 columns based on screen size
- [ ] Cards maintain 16px spacing between them
- [ ] Empty state displays helpful message and CTA
- [ ] Loading states provide smooth user feedback
- [ ] Grid handles large personality collections efficiently
- [ ] Edit/Clone actions integrate with card components
- [ ] Container scrolls properly when content overflows
- [ ] Responsive behavior works across all device sizes

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for grid rendering with various personality counts
- Test responsive breakpoints work correctly
- Verify empty state displays when no personalities exist
- Test loading states and transitions
- Integration tests for edit/clone functionality
- Accessibility tests for grid navigation

## Dependencies

- PersonalityCard component from T-create-personality-card
- Zustand store integration from T-create-personality-data-types
- shadcn/ui components for layout and loading states
- CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive layout
- Interactive Tab System Foundation for tab integration

## Security Considerations

- Validate personality data before rendering
- Sanitize any user-generated content in cards
- Handle edge cases with malformed data gracefully

## Performance Requirements

- Efficient rendering of large personality collections
- Smooth responsive transitions (< 200ms)
- Lazy loading for very large lists (if needed)
- Optimized re-renders when personality data changes
- Smooth animations for empty/loading state transitions
