## Implementation Guidance

### Component Architecture

```typescript
interface Personality {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  bigFive: {
    openness: number;
    conscientiousness: number;
    extraversion: number;
    agreeableness: number;
    neuroticism: number;
  };
  behaviors: {
    [key: string]: number; // 14 behavior traits
  };
  customInstructions: string;
}

interface PersonalityFormData {
  name: string;
  traits: PersonalityTraits;
  customInstructions: string;
}
```

### Big Five Trait Implementation

- Use shadcn/ui Slider components for each trait
- Range: 0-100 with step size of 1
- Live value display next to each slider
- Visual feedback for trait changes
- Trait descriptions/tooltips for user guidance

### Behavior Sliders Design

- Collapsible section using shadcn/ui Collapsible
- Grouped organization of related behaviors
- Consistent slider styling and spacing
- Clear labels for each behavior dimension
- Tooltips explaining behavior impacts

### Form Validation

- Required field validation for personality name
- Character limits for custom instructions (500 chars)
- Real-time validation feedback
- Submit button state management
- Error message display patterns

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing

- All sliders update values correctly and persist
- Form validation works across all fields
- Collapsible section animates smoothly
- Tab switching preserves form state
- Save functionality handles success/error states

### User Experience Testing

- Slider interactions feel responsive and precise
- Form feels intuitive and not overwhelming
- Visual feedback is clear and helpful
- Collapsible section discovery is obvious
- Empty states guide users effectively

### Accessibility Testing

- All form controls keyboard accessible
- Sliders announce values to screen readers
- Form labels properly associated
- Collapsible section accessible
- Focus management during interactions

## Security Considerations

- Input validation for personality names
- Sanitization of custom instructions
- Proper handling of slider value ranges
- Protection against form injection attacks

## Performance Requirements

- Slider updates feel immediate (< 50ms response)
- Form validation provides instant feedback
- Collapsible animations are smooth (200ms)
- Large personality lists render efficiently
- Tab switching maintains 200ms transitions

## Dependencies

- Requires: F-interactive-tab-system (Interactive Tab System Foundation)
- Requires: shadcn/ui Card, Slider, Input, Textarea, Collapsible components
- Requires: Form validation library integration
- Integrates: Zustand store for personality management

## Estimated Tasks: 12-18 tasks (1-2 hours each)
