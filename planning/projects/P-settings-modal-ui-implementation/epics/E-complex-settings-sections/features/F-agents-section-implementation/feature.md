# Agents Section Implementation

## Purpose

Implement the complete Agents settings section with three functional tabs (Library, Templates, Defaults) featuring search functionality, agent cards, template displays, and configuration sliders.

## Key Components to Implement

### Library Tab

- Interactive search bar with real-time filtering
- Agent cards displaying icon, name, model, and role
- Edit and delete buttons (styled but non-functional as specified)
- Empty state with friendly messaging and call-to-action
- Add button for creating new agents

### Templates Tab

- Pre-configured agent template cards in responsive layout
- Template cards with icons, names, descriptions
- "Use Template" buttons with proper styling
- Hover states and interactive feedback
- Responsive grid layout for various screen sizes

### Defaults Tab

- Temperature slider (0-2) with live value display
- Max Tokens number input with validation styling
- Top P slider (0-1) with precise value control
- Real-time preview of setting changes
- Reset to defaults functionality

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Library Tab Implementation

- [ ] Search bar with "Search agents..." placeholder and proper styling
- [ ] Real-time search filtering of agent list
- [ ] Agent cards in scrollable list with consistent styling
- [ ] Each card shows: agent icon, name, model, role information
- [ ] Edit and delete buttons positioned right-aligned
- [ ] Empty state: "No agents configured. Create your first agent!" with friendly styling
- [ ] "+ Create New Agent" button at bottom with primary styling
- [ ] Smooth animations for card interactions

### Templates Tab Implementation

- [ ] Pre-configured template cards in responsive 2-3 column layout
- [ ] Each template card shows: icon, name, description
- [ ] "Use Template" button with consistent styling
- [ ] Card hover states with subtle elevation changes
- [ ] Proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- [ ] Template categories if applicable
- [ ] Loading states for template fetching

### Defaults Tab Implementation

- [ ] Temperature slider (0-2) with current value display (e.g., "1.2")
- [ ] Max Tokens number input with validation styling and constraints
- [ ] Top P slider (0-1) with precise decimal value display (e.g., "0.95")
- [ ] Live preview of how settings affect agent behavior
- [ ] "Reset to Defaults" button with confirmation
- [ ] Tooltips explaining each setting's purpose
- [ ] Visual feedback for setting changes

### Integration Requirements

- [ ] Uses Interactive Tab System Foundation for tab navigation
- [ ] Integrates with Zustand store for state management
- [ ] Responsive behavior across all screen sizes
- [ ] Consistent styling with other settings sections
- [ ] Proper accessibility attributes throughout

## Implementation Guidance

### Component Architecture

```typescript
interface AgentCard {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  model: string;
  role: string;
  icon: string;
}

interface AgentTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  configuration: AgentConfiguration;
}

interface AgentDefaults {
  temperature: number;
  maxTokens: number;
  topP: number;
}
```

### Search Implementation

- Debounced search input (300ms delay)
- Case-insensitive filtering across name, model, role
- Empty results handling with helpful suggestions
- Search history or recent searches

### Card Design Patterns

- Consistent card styling using shadcn/ui Card component
- Hover states with subtle shadow/elevation changes
- Loading skeletons for async content
- Error states for failed operations

### Slider Configuration

- Use shadcn/ui Slider component
- Custom value display components
- Range validation and constraints
- Smooth value updates with proper debouncing

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing

- Search functionality works accurately and efficiently
- All interactive elements respond correctly
- Slider values update and persist properly
- Responsive layout functions on all screen sizes
- Tab switching maintains component state

### User Experience Testing

- Search feels responsive and immediate
- Card interactions provide clear feedback
- Slider adjustments are intuitive and precise
- Empty states guide users effectively
- Loading states don't block interactions

### Accessibility Testing

- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Screen readers can navigate cards and controls
- Form labels properly associated
- Focus management works correctly

## Security Considerations

- Input validation for search queries
- Sanitization of user-provided content
- Proper handling of agent configuration data
- Protection against XSS in card content

## Performance Requirements

- Search results update in under 300ms
- Card rendering optimized for 100+ items
- Slider interactions feel immediate (< 50ms)
- Tab switching maintains smooth 200ms transitions
- Lazy loading for large agent lists

## Dependencies

- Requires: F-interactive-tab-system (Interactive Tab System Foundation)
- Requires: shadcn/ui Card, Slider, Input components
- Requires: Lucide React icons for agents and actions
- Integrates: Zustand store for agent management

## Estimated Tasks: 10-15 tasks (1-2 hours each)
