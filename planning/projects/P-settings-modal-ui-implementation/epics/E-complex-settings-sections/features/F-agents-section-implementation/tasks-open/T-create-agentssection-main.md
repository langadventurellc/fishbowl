# Create AgentsSection Main Container Component

## Context

This task creates the main container component for the Agents settings section that will house three functional tabs: Library, Templates, and Defaults. This component belongs in the **desktop project** (`apps/desktop/src/`), while prop interfaces and shared types belong in the **shared package** (`packages/shared/src/types/`).

**Important**: This is UI/UX development only - no backend integration required. Focus on demonstrating what a working system's interface would look like.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Component Structure

Create `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/AgentsSection.tsx`:

- Main container component using Interactive Tab System Foundation
- Three tabs: "Library", "Templates", "Defaults"
- Proper tab navigation and content switching
- Responsive layout that works on all screen sizes

### 2. Shared Types (in packages/shared/src/types/)

Create or extend existing types files:

```typescript
// Agent-related interfaces
interface AgentCard {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  model: string;
  role: string;
  icon: string;
}

interface AgentTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  configuration: AgentConfiguration;
}

interface AgentDefaults {
  temperature: number;
  maxTokens: number;
  topP: number;
}

// Component props interfaces
interface AgentsSectionProps {
  className?: string;
}
```

### 3. Component Implementation

- Use shadcn/ui components (Tabs, Card)
- Implement proper tab state management
- Add loading states for tab content
- Include proper accessibility attributes
- Responsive design with proper breakpoints

### 4. Integration Points

- Placeholder content for each tab (will be replaced by specific tab components)
- Proper styling consistent with other settings sections
- Tab switching with smooth 200ms transitions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AgentsSection component renders with three functional tabs
- [ ] Tab navigation works smoothly with proper transitions
- [ ] Component is responsive across all screen sizes
- [ ] Placeholder content shows in each tab area
- [ ] Proper TypeScript interfaces defined in shared package
- [ ] Component includes proper accessibility attributes
- [ ] Styling matches existing settings sections design
- [ ] Unit tests cover component rendering and tab switching

## Technical Approach

1. Create shared types in `packages/shared/src/types/agents.ts`
2. Create main component in `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/AgentsSection.tsx`
3. Use Interactive Tab System Foundation as base structure
4. Add responsive layout using Tailwind classes
5. Include unit tests in same file structure
6. Verify component integration with existing settings modal

## Dependencies

- Requires F-interactive-tab-system to be completed
- Uses shadcn/ui Tabs component
- Integrates with existing settings modal structure

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for component rendering
- Tab switching functionality tests
- Responsive behavior verification
- Accessibility testing for keyboard navigation
