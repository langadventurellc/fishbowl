# Add Loading States and Smooth Animations Throughout

## Context

Enhance all Agents section components with polished loading states and smooth animations to create a premium user experience. This involves refining existing components in the **desktop project** (`apps/desktop/src/`).

**Important**: This is UI/UX development only - create realistic loading states that demonstrate what users would experience with real data loading.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Loading State Components

Create reusable loading components:

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/AgentCardSkeleton.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/TemplateCardSkeleton.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/SearchSkeleton.tsx`

### 2. Animation Library Setup

Configure Framer Motion or CSS transitions for smooth animations:

- Install and configure animation dependencies if needed
- Create consistent animation timing and easing
- Define reusable animation variants
- Ensure animations respect user's motion preferences

### 3. Loading States Implementation

#### Library Tab Loading

- Search bar skeleton while component initializes
- Grid of AgentCard skeletons (6-8 cards)
- Shimmer effect for realistic loading appearance
- Smooth transition from loading to content

#### Templates Tab Loading

- Grid of TemplateCard skeletons (6-9 cards)
- Skeleton maintains template card dimensions
- Staggered loading animation for visual interest
- Smooth fade-in of actual content

#### Defaults Tab Loading

- Slider control skeletons with proper spacing
- Input field loading states
- Smooth transitions for interactive elements
- Realistic loading durations

### 4. Smooth Animations

#### Card Interactions

- Hover state transitions (200ms ease-out)
- Button press animations with scale effects
- Focus state transitions for accessibility
- Smooth card elevation changes

#### Tab Transitions

- Smooth content switching between tabs
- Fade in/out animations for tab content
- Loading state transitions
- Proper exit/enter animations

#### Search Interactions

- Smooth filtering animations as results change
- Card appearance/disappearance transitions
- Search input focus animations
- Clear search button animations

### 5. Performance Optimizations

- GPU-accelerated animations using transform/opacity
- Reduce layout thrashing during animations
- Optimize animation performance for lower-end devices
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion media query

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All components show realistic loading states
- [ ] Card hover animations are smooth and consistent (200ms)
- [ ] Tab switching has smooth content transitions
- [ ] Search filtering animates results smoothly
- [ ] Loading skeletons match final content dimensions
- [ ] Animations respect user motion preferences
- [ ] All interactions feel responsive and polished
- [ ] No animation jank or performance issues
- [ ] Unit tests verify animation states

## Technical Approach

1. Create skeleton components for all major UI elements
2. Add CSS transitions or Framer Motion for animations
3. Implement staggered loading animations
4. Add hover and focus state animations
5. Create smooth tab transition effects
6. Add search result animation effects
7. Include animation performance optimizations
8. Test animations across different devices and browsers

## Animation Specifications

### Timing and Easing

- Hover transitions: 200ms ease-out
- Focus transitions: 150ms ease-out
- Loading animations: 1.5s ease-in-out (repeating)
- Tab transitions: 300ms ease-in-out
- Search result changes: 250ms ease-out

### Animation Types

- **Cards**: scale(1.02) + shadow increase on hover
- **Buttons**: scale(0.98) on press, scale(1.05) on hover
- **Sliders**: smooth handle movement with easing
- **Tab content**: fade in/out with slight vertical movement
- **Search results**: staggered fade-in for new results

### Loading Skeletons

- Use shimmer effect with CSS gradients
- Match exact dimensions of final content
- Proper aspect ratios for cards and components
- Subtle pulse animation (1.5s cycle)

## Skeleton Component Specifications

### AgentCardSkeleton

```tsx
- Card container with skeleton styling
- Icon placeholder (24x24px circle)
- Name placeholder (full width, 18px height)
- Model placeholder (75% width, 14px height)
- Role placeholder (60% width, 14px height)
- Button placeholders (right-aligned)
```

### TemplateCardSkeleton

```tsx
- Card container matching TemplateCard dimensions
- Icon placeholder (32x32px circle, centered)
- Name placeholder (80% width, centered)
- Description placeholder (3 lines, varying widths)
- Button placeholder (full width)
```

## Animation Implementation Examples

### Card Hover Animation

```css
.agent-card {
  transition:
    transform 200ms ease-out,
    box-shadow 200ms ease-out;
}

.agent-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Search Result Transitions

```tsx
// Staggered animation for search results
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1,
    },
  },
};
```

## Accessibility Considerations

- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference
- Provide option to disable animations
- Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
- Maintain proper focus management during animations
- Loading states announce properly to assistive technology

## Testing Requirements

- Visual regression testing for animation states
- Performance testing on lower-end devices
- Animation timing verification
- Loading state display testing
- Accessibility testing with motion preferences
- Cross-browser animation compatibility testing

## Dependencies

- CSS transitions or Framer Motion for animations
- shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Proper CSS variables for theme-aware animations
- React hooks for animation state management
