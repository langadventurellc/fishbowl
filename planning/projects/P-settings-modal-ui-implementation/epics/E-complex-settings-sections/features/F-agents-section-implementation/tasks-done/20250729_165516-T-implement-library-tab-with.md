# Implement Library Tab with Search and Agent Cards

## Context

Create the Library tab component with interactive search functionality and agent card display. This component belongs in the **desktop project** (`apps/desktop/src/`), while shared interfaces belong in the **shared package**.

**Important**: This is UI/UX development only - use hardcoded mock data within the component for immediate demonstration. No backend integration required.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Component Creation

Create `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/LibraryTab.tsx`:

- Search bar with "Search agents..." placeholder
- Real-time filtering of hardcoded agent list
- Agent cards in scrollable container
- Empty state handling
- "Create New Agent" button

### 2. Hardcoded Mock Data

Include realistic mock data directly in component:

```typescript
const mockAgents: AgentCard[] = [
  {
    id: "1",
    name: "Research Assistant",
    model: "Claude 3.5 Sonnet",
    role: "Research and Analysis",
    icon: "BookOpen",
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    name: "Code Reviewer",
    model: "GPT-4",
    role: "Code Analysis",
    icon: "Code",
  },
  // Add 8-10 more realistic examples
];
```

### 3. Search Functionality

- Debounced search input (300ms delay)
- Case-insensitive filtering across name, model, role
- Real-time results update
- Clear search functionality
- Empty results state with helpful message

### 4. Agent Cards Design

- Use shadcn/ui Card component
- Display: agent icon (Lucide React), name, model, role
- Edit and delete buttons (styled but non-functional)
- Hover states with subtle elevation
- Consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
- Loading skeleton states

### 5. Layout & Interaction

- Scrollable card container with proper spacing
- Responsive grid/list layout
- Smooth animations for card interactions
- Empty state: "No agents configured. Create your first agent!"
- Primary styled "Create New Agent" button

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search bar filters agents in real-time (300ms debounce)
- [ ] Agent cards display all required information clearly
- [ ] Edit/delete buttons present and styled (non-functional as specified)
- [ ] Empty state shows when no results found
- [ ] "Create New Agent" button styled as primary action
- [ ] Cards have proper hover states and animations
- [ ] Component is fully responsive
- [ ] Search works across name, model, and role fields
- [ ] Unit tests cover search functionality and rendering

## Technical Approach

1. Create LibraryTab component with useState for search and filtering
2. Implement debounced search using useCallback and useEffect
3. Create AgentCard sub-component for individual cards
4. Add hardcoded mock data with realistic agent examples
5. Style using shadcn/ui components and Tailwind classes
6. Include unit tests for search and rendering logic
7. Add proper TypeScript typing throughout

## UI/UX Focus

- Search feels immediate and responsive
- Cards provide clear visual hierarchy
- Hover states give appropriate feedback
- Empty states guide users effectively
- Loading states don't block interactions
- All interactions feel polished and intentional

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for search filtering logic
- Component rendering with mock data
- Search debouncing functionality
- Empty state display conditions
- Responsive layout verification

### Log

**2025-07-29T21:55:16.891795Z** - Successfully implemented the complete Library tab with search functionality and agent cards display. Replaced the placeholder LibraryTab component with a fully functional interface featuring:

• Real-time search with 300ms debouncing across agent name, model, and role fields
• Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns desktop) with 8 realistic mock agents  
• Agent cards displaying icons, names, models, and roles with hover states and edit/delete buttons
• Search input with magnifying glass icon and "Search agents..." placeholder
• Empty state handling with conditional messaging for no results vs no agents
• "Create New Agent" primary button with plus icon
• Proper accessibility attributes and keyboard navigation
• shadcn/ui Card, Input, and Button components with consistent styling
• Icon mapping system using Lucide React icons with fallback to BookOpen

All quality checks pass (linting, formatting, type checking) and component tests are updated and passing. The implementation uses hardcoded mock data as specified and follows established component patterns from the codebase.
