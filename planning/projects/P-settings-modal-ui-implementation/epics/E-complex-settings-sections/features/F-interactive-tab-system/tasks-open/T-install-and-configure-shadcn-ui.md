# Install and Configure shadcn/ui Tabs Component

## Context

The Interactive Tab System Foundation feature requires replacing custom tab components with shadcn/ui Tabs. Currently, the desktop app uses custom `SubNavigationTab` components (see `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SubNavigationTab.tsx`) that need to be replaced with the official shadcn/ui implementation.

## Implementation Requirements

### Install shadcn/ui Tabs Component

- Add the shadcn/ui Tabs component to the desktop app using the shadcn CLI
- Run: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add tabs` in the desktop app directory
- Verify the component files are created in `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/`
- Include all Tabs sub-components: `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `TabsContent`

### Component Integration Setup

- Import Tabs components in the settings module: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/index.ts`
- Add TypeScript type definitions for tab configurations
- Ensure proper integration with existing Tailwind CSS setup
- Verify Radix UI dependencies are correctly installed

### Configuration and Testing

- Create basic usage example to verify installation works correctly
- Test component renders without errors in the settings context
- Verify accessibility attributes are properly included from Radix UI base
- Write unit tests for the basic Tabs component functionality

## Technical Approach

1. **Installation Process**:

   ```bash
   cd apps/desktop
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add tabs
   ```

2. **Verification Steps**:
   - Check `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/tabs.tsx` is created
   - Verify imports work: `import { Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent } from "../ui/tabs"`
   - Test basic rendering in existing settings structure

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Prepare for integration with existing `SettingsNavigation` component
   - Ensure compatibility with current Zustand store structure
   - Maintain existing responsive behavior patterns

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] shadcn/ui Tabs component successfully installed in desktop app
- [ ] All Tabs sub-components (Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent) are available
- [ ] Components can be imported without errors from settings modules
- [ ] Basic tab functionality works (click to switch tabs)
- [ ] Radix UI accessibility attributes are included by default

### Technical Implementation

- [ ] No build errors or TypeScript compilation issues
- [ ] Unit tests verify basic component functionality

### Integration Readiness

- [ ] Components exported from settings index file for easy importing
- [ ] Compatible with existing component architecture patterns
- [ ] Ready for integration with Zustand state management
- [ ] Prepared for responsive design requirements

## Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests verifying component installation and basic functionality
- Test component rendering without errors in settings context
- Verify accessibility attributes are present and functional
- Validate TypeScript types are working correctly

## Security Considerations

- Ensure proper input sanitization for tab labels and content
- Verify no XSS vulnerabilities in dynamic tab content
