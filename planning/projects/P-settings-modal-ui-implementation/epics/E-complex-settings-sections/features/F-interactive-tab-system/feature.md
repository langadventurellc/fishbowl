# Interactive Tab System Foundation

## Purpose

Implement a reusable, fully interactive tab system using shadcn/ui Tabs components that provides smooth transitions, keyboard navigation, and consistent styling across all complex settings sections.

## Key Components to Implement

### Enhanced Tab Navigation Component

- Replace placeholder tab styling with functional shadcn/ui Tabs
- Implement smooth 200ms content transitions between tabs
- Add keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, tab key, enter)
- Ensure ARIA accessibility compliance
- Mobile-responsive behavior for narrow screens

### Tab State Management Integration

- Integrate tab switching with Zustand store for persistence
- Handle active tab highlighting with accent color
- Manage sub-tab state independently from main navigation
- Sync tab state between navigation and content areas

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] shadcn/ui Tabs component used consistently across all sections
- [ ] Tab content switching with smooth 200ms transitions
- [ ] Active tab highlighting with proper accent color styling
- [ ] Keyboard navigation: arrow keys switch tabs, tab key moves focus
- [ ] Enter key activates focused tab
- [ ] Responsive tab behavior: horizontal on desktop, stacked on very narrow screens
- [ ] Proper ARIA labels and screen reader support

### Technical Implementation

- [ ] Reusable TabContainer component accepting tab configuration
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for tab definitions and state
- [ ] Integration with existing SettingsSubTab types from shared package
- [ ] Consistent styling using Tailwind classes
- [ ] Performance optimization for rapid tab switching

### Integration Points

- [ ] Works with existing SettingsNavigation component
- [ ] Maintains state sync with Zustand store
- [ ] Compatible with existing responsive layout system
- [ ] Supports all three complex sections (Agents, Personalities, Roles)

## Implementation Guidance

### Component Architecture

```typescript
interface TabConfiguration {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  content: React.ComponentType;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

interface InteractiveTabsProps {
  tabs: TabConfiguration[];
  activeTab: string;
  onTabChange: (tabId: string) => void;
  className?: string;
}
```

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy load tab content components
- Debounce rapid tab switching
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo
- Smooth animations using CSS transitions

### Accessibility Requirements

- Focus management during tab switching
- Screen reader announcements for tab changes
- High contrast visual focus indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts documented

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing

- Tab switching works correctly across all browsers
- Keyboard navigation behaves as expected
- State persistence works during modal sessions
- Responsive behavior functions on all screen sizes

### Accessibility Testing

- Screen reader compatibility verified
- Keyboard-only navigation possible
- Focus indicators clearly visible
- ARIA attributes properly implemented

## Security Considerations

- Input sanitization for tab labels
- Proper component isolation
- No XSS vulnerabilities in dynamic content

## Performance Requirements

- Tab switching completes in under 200ms
- No layout shift during transitions
- Smooth animations on mobile devices
- Memory efficient tab content management

## Dependencies

- Requires: SettingsNavigation component
- Requires: Zustand store integration
- Requires: shadcn/ui Tabs component installed
- Enables: All subsequent tab-based features

## Estimated Tasks: 8-12 tasks (1-2 hours each)
