# Add Enhanced Keyboard Navigation with Arrow Keys and ARIA Support

## Context

Enhance the TabContainer component with comprehensive keyboard navigation support, building on the existing `useNavigationKeyboard` hook (`apps/desktop/src/hooks/useNavigationKeyboard.ts`). The current system supports basic keyboard navigation, but we need to extend it for proper tab navigation patterns with arrow keys, tab key behavior, and full ARIA compliance.

## Implementation Requirements

### Keyboard Navigation Patterns

- **Arrow Keys**: Left/Right arrows switch between tabs within the same section
- **Tab Key**: Moves focus to next focusable element (standard behavior)
- **Enter/Space**: Activates the focused tab
- **Home/End**: Jump to first/last tab in the current tab group
- **Escape**: Move focus back to parent section (if applicable)

### ARIA Compliance Implementation

```typescript
// ARIA attributes to implement
interface TabARIAAttributes {
  role: "tablist" | "tab" | "tabpanel";
  "aria-selected": boolean;
  "aria-controls": string;
  "aria-labelledby": string;
  "aria-orientation": "horizontal" | "vertical";
  tabIndex: number; // 0 for active, -1 for inactive
}
```

### Integration with Existing Navigation

- Extend current `useNavigationKeyboard` hook to support tab-specific navigation
- Maintain compatibility with existing section-level navigation
- Ensure smooth transitions between section navigation and tab navigation
- Preserve focus management during tab switches

## Technical Approach

1. **Enhanced Hook Extension**:
   - Modify `useNavigationKeyboard` to detect when focus is within a tab group
   - Add tab-specific key handling for arrow key navigation
   - Implement proper focus trapping within tab groups
   - Handle edge cases for first/last tab navigation

2. **ARIA Implementation**:

   ```tsx
   // Example ARIA structure
   <div role="tablist" aria-orientation="horizontal">
     <button role="tab" aria-selected={active} aria-controls={`panel-${id}`} tabIndex={active ? 0 : -1}>
       {label}
     </button>
   </div>
   <div role="tabpanel" id={`panel-${id}`} aria-labelledby={`tab-${id}`}>
     {content}
   </div>
   ```

3. **Focus Management**:
   - Proper focus indicators using existing `COMMON_FOCUS_CLASSES`
   - Focus trapping within tab groups when navigating with arrows
   - Focus restoration when returning to parent navigation
   - High contrast and reduced motion support

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Keyboard Navigation Requirements

- [ ] Left/Right arrow keys switch between tabs in the current section
- [ ] Tab key moves focus to next focusable element (not next tab)
- [ ] Enter and Space keys activate the focused tab
- [ ] Home key moves to first tab in current tab group
- [ ] End key moves to last tab in current tab group
- [ ] Escape key returns focus to parent section navigation
- [ ] Focus indicators clearly visible during keyboard navigation

### ARIA Accessibility Compliance

- [ ] All tabs have proper `role="tab"` attribute
- [ ] Tab panels have proper `role="tabpanel"` attribute
- [ ] Tab container has `role="tablist"` attribute
- [ ] Active tabs have `aria-selected="true"`
- [ ] Inactive tabs have `aria-selected="false"`
- [ ] Proper `aria-controls` linking tabs to panels
- [ ] Correct `tabIndex` values: 0 for active, -1 for inactive
- [ ] Screen reader announces tab changes correctly

### Integration Quality

- [ ] Works seamlessly with existing `useNavigationKeyboard` hook
- [ ] Compatible with current section-level navigation
- [ ] Maintains focus management during tab transitions
- [ ] Preserves existing keyboard navigation for non-tab elements
- [ ] No conflicts with modal keyboard navigation
- [ ] Smooth integration with animation system

### Desktop Window Responsive Behavior

- [ ] Tab layout adapts to window resizing in Electron desktop app
- [ ] Focus management works properly during window size changes
- [ ] Screen reader support on desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing

- Test all keyboard combinations in different tab configurations
- Verify focus management during rapid navigation
- Test edge cases (first tab, last tab, single tab)
- Verify integration with existing navigation system
- Test with different screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

### Accessibility Testing

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- High contrast mode support verification
- Reduced motion preference testing
- Keyboard-only navigation testing

### Integration Testing

- Test with all three complex sections (agents, personalities, roles)
- Verify compatibility with existing settings navigation
- Test focus management during modal opening/closing
- Performance testing with rapid keyboard navigation

## Security Considerations

- Proper input validation for keyboard events
- XSS prevention in dynamic ARIA attributes
- Safe focus management without DOM vulnerabilities
- Secure handling of navigation state changes

## Performance Requirements

- Keyboard navigation response time under 16ms
- No lag during rapid arrow key navigation
- Efficient focus management without memory leaks
- Smooth integration with 200ms tab transitions

## Desktop Platform Support and Compatibility

- Modern screen readers (NVDA 2019+, JAWS 2020+, VoiceOver)
- Electron keyboard event handling
- High contrast mode support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Desktop accessibility features integration

## Dependencies

- Requires: T-create-tabcontainer-component (TabContainer component with basic functionality)
- Uses: Existing `useNavigationKeyboard` hook and focus management utilities
- Integrates: Current ARIA patterns from `SubNavigationTab` component
- Enables: Complete interactive tab system implementation

## Reference Implementation

- Current keyboard navigation: `apps/desktop/src/hooks/useNavigationKeyboard.ts`
- Existing ARIA patterns: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SubNavigationTab.tsx`
- Focus management utilities: `apps/desktop/src/styles/focus.ts`

## Estimated Completion Time: 2 hours

### Log

**2025-07-28T21:22:34.749061Z** - Successfully implemented enhanced keyboard navigation with arrow keys and comprehensive ARIA support for the TabContainer component. Added comprehensive keyboard navigation following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines with bidirectional arrow key support (Left/Right for horizontal tabs), focus management, screen reader announcements, and full accessibility compliance. The implementation includes a specialized useEnhancedTabNavigation hook that extends existing navigation patterns with tab-specific features like automatic/manual activation modes, proper ARIA attributes (role, aria-selected, aria-controls, aria-labelledby), and seamless integration with shadcn/ui Tabs primitives.
