# Install and Configure shadcn/ui Tabs Component

## Context

The Interactive Tab System Foundation feature requires replacing custom tab components with shadcn/ui Tabs. Currently, the desktop app uses custom `SubNavigationTab` components (see `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SubNavigationTab.tsx`) that need to be replaced with the official shadcn/ui implementation.

## Implementation Requirements

### Install shadcn/ui Tabs Component

- Add the shadcn/ui Tabs component to the desktop app using the shadcn CLI
- Run: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add tabs` in the desktop app directory
- Verify the component files are created in `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/`
- Include all Tabs sub-components: `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `TabsContent`

### Component Integration Setup

- Import Tabs components in the settings module: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/index.ts`
- Add TypeScript type definitions for tab configurations
- Ensure proper integration with existing Tailwind CSS setup
- Verify Radix UI dependencies are correctly installed

### Configuration and Testing

- Create basic usage example to verify installation works correctly
- Test component renders without errors in the settings context
- Verify accessibility attributes are properly included from Radix UI base
- Write unit tests for the basic Tabs component functionality

## Technical Approach

1. **Installation Process**:

   ```bash
   cd apps/desktop
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add tabs
   ```

2. **Verification Steps**:
   - Check `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/tabs.tsx` is created
   - Verify imports work: `import { Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent } from "../ui/tabs"`
   - Test basic rendering in existing settings structure

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Prepare for integration with existing `SettingsNavigation` component
   - Ensure compatibility with current Zustand store structure
   - Maintain existing responsive behavior patterns

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] shadcn/ui Tabs component successfully installed in desktop app
- [ ] All Tabs sub-components (Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent) are available
- [ ] Components can be imported without errors from settings modules
- [ ] Basic tab functionality works (click to switch tabs)
- [ ] Radix UI accessibility attributes are included by default

### Technical Implementation

- [ ] Component files created in `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly configured and working
- [ ] Integration with existing Tailwind CSS setup is functional
- [ ] No build errors or TypeScript compilation issues
- [ ] Unit tests verify basic component functionality

### Integration Readiness

- [ ] Components exported from settings index file for easy importing
- [ ] Compatible with existing component architecture patterns
- [ ] Ready for integration with Zustand state management
- [ ] Prepared for responsive design requirements

## Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests verifying component installation and basic functionality
- Test component rendering without errors in settings context
- Verify accessibility attributes are present and functional
- Validate TypeScript types are working correctly

## Security Considerations

- Ensure proper input sanitization for tab labels and content
- Verify no XSS vulnerabilities in dynamic tab content
- Maintain component isolation and proper prop validation

## Dependencies

- Requires: Desktop app environment and shadcn CLI access
- Enables: All subsequent tab system implementation tasks
- Foundation for: TabContainer component and enhanced navigation

## Estimated Completion Time: 1-2 hours

### Log

**2025-07-28T20:48:35.659914Z** - Successfully installed and configured shadcn/ui Tabs component in the desktop application. The installation provides a solid foundation for implementing interactive tab systems across complex settings sections (Agents, Personalities, Roles).

Key accomplishments:

- Installed shadcn/ui Tabs component using latest CLI (updated from deprecated shadcn-ui to shadcn)
- Added @radix-ui/react-tabs@^1.1.12 dependency automatically during installation
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for tab configuration in shared package
- Integrated Tabs components with settings module for convenient access
- Wrote complete unit test suite verifying component functionality, theme integration, and accessibility
- Created integration tests demonstrating usage patterns for all three complex settings sections
- Verified theme compatibility with existing claymorphism design system
- All quality checks passed (linting, formatting, type checking)
- All tests passed successfully (253 passed, 0 failed)

The component is ready for integration with Zustand state management and provides:

- Full Radix UI accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- Theme integration with bg-muted, text-muted-foreground classes
- Support for disabled tabs, custom styling, and responsive behavior
- Foundation for 200ms smooth transitions in future implementation
- Compatible architecture for next task: creating TabContainer component
- filesChanged: ["apps/desktop/src/components/ui/tabs.tsx", "apps/desktop/package.json", "apps/desktop/src/components/settings/index.ts", "packages/shared/src/types/settings/TabConfiguration.ts", "packages/shared/src/types/settings/InteractiveTabsProps.ts", "packages/shared/src/types/settings/TabSectionConfiguration.ts", "packages/shared/src/types/settings/index.ts", "apps/desktop/src/components/ui/__tests__/tabs.test.tsx", "apps/desktop/src/components/settings/__tests__/TabsIntegration.test.tsx"]
