# Replace AppearanceSettings Placeholder with Theme Selection UI

## Context

Replace the current placeholder AppearanceSettings component in `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsContent.tsx` (lines 407-442) with a fully functional theme selection section. This task focuses on UI/UX implementation without connecting to actual theme switching functionality.

## Implementation Requirements

### Component Structure

Replace the existing AppearanceSettings component with:

- Section title: "Appearance" with 24px font and 20px margin-bottom
- Section description: "Customize the appearance and theme of the application"
- Theme selection group with proper visual hierarchy

### Theme Selection Group

- Group title: "Theme" with 18px font, semi-bold weight
- Use shadcn/ui RadioGroup component in vertical layout
- Three theme options:
  - "Light" radio button with proper label
  - "Dark" radio button with proper label
  - "System" radio button with label and helper text
- Local state management for UX demonstration (no persistence needed)

### Theme Preview Area

- Exactly 200px width Ã— 100px height preview area
- Static visual representation showing theme colors
- Background, text, and accent color representation
- Border and styling to clearly indicate preview area
- Placeholder content showing theme concept

### Technical Approach

```tsx
// Use existing patterns from GeneralSettings
import { RadioGroup, RadioGroupItem } from "@/components/ui/radio-group";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";

// Local state for UX demonstration
const [selectedTheme, setSelectedTheme] = useState<"light" | "dark" | "system">(
  "system",
);

// Follow existing component structure and styling patterns
```

### Styling Requirements

- Follow exact spacing and typography from feature specification
- Use consistent styling patterns from GeneralSettings component
- Implement responsive behavior for mobile devices
- Ensure proper visual hierarchy with existing modal structure

### Accessibility Requirements

- Proper ARIA attributes for radio group
- Screen reader compatible labels and descriptions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators matching existing patterns

### Unit Tests

Include basic unit tests in the same task:

- Component renders without errors
- Radio group selection updates state correctly
- Preview area displays with correct dimensions
- Accessibility attributes are present

## Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsContent.tsx` - Replace AppearanceSettings component (lines 407-442)
