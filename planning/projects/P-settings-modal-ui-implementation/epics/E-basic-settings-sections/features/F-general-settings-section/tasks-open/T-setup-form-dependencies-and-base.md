# Setup form dependencies and base infrastructure

## Context

Replace placeholder mockups in the existing `GeneralSettings` component with fully functional shadcn/ui form components. The component is located at `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsContent.tsx` lines 33-74.

## Implementation Requirements

### Install Required Dependencies

Install the necessary packages for form handling and validation:

- `react-hook-form` for form state management
- `@hookform/resolvers` for schema integration
- `zod` for validation schemas
- Install shadcn/ui form components: `form`, `input`, `slider`, `radio-group`, `switch`, `label`

### Create Form Foundation

1. **Import form dependencies** in the `GeneralSettings` component:

   ```tsx
   import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
   import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
   import { z } from "zod";
   import {
     Form,
     FormField,
     FormItem,
     FormLabel,
     FormControl,
     FormMessage,
   } from "@/components/ui/form";
   ```

2. **Create base validation schema structure**:

   ```tsx
   const GeneralSettingsSchema = z.object({
     // Schema fields will be added in subsequent tasks
   });
   ```

3. **Setup form hook structure**:

   ```tsx
   const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof GeneralSettingsSchema>>({
     resolver: zodResolver(GeneralSettingsSchema),
     defaultValues: {
       // Default values will be added in subsequent tasks
     },
   });
   ```

4. **Wrap existing content in Form component**:
   ```tsx
   <Form {...form}>
     <form className="space-y-6">
       {/* Existing group structures remain, content updated in subsequent tasks */}
     </form>
   </Form>
   ```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All required dependencies are installed and properly imported
- [ ] shadcn/ui form components are added to the project via CLI
- [ ] Base form structure is established with Form wrapper
- [ ] Zod schema placeholder is created (ready for field additions)
- [ ] useForm hook is configured with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Existing visual structure and styling is preserved
- [ ] No functional changes to current placeholder mockups (saves breaking changes for next tasks)
- [ ] Unit tests verify form foundation renders without errors

## Dependencies

This task has no prerequisites and enables all subsequent form implementation tasks.

## Security Considerations

- Use TypeScript for type safety in form schemas
- Validate input ranges at the schema level
- No sensitive data involved in General settings

## Testing Requirements

- Write unit test to verify form component renders successfully
- Test that form hook initializes with correct default structure
- Verify no console errors or TypeScript issues after changes
