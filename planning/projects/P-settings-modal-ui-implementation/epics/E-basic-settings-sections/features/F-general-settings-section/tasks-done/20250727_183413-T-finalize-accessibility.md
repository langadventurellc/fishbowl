# Finalize accessibility, responsive behavior, and visual polish

## Context

Complete the General Settings implementation by ensuring it meets all visual specifications, accessibility standards, and responsive design requirements from the feature specification. This final polish ensures the form is production-ready and provides an excellent user experience.

## Implementation Requirements

### Exact Visual Specifications

Verify the implementation matches the detailed visual requirements:

#### Section Title and Description

- [ ] Section title: "General" with exact 24px font and 20px margin-bottom
- [ ] Section description with proper muted text styling and spacing
- [ ] Three distinct form groups with clear visual separation

#### Typography and Spacing

- [ ] Group titles: 18px font size, semi-bold weight, consistent spacing
- [ ] Helper text: 13px font size, muted foreground color, consistent positioning below inputs
- [ ] Form groups maintain space-y-6 between groups
- [ ] Form fields within groups maintain space-y-4 spacing

#### Component-Specific Visual Requirements

- [ ] Response Delay slider: Live value display in "X seconds" format
- [ ] Maximum Messages: Show "Unlimited" when 0, otherwise "X messages"
- [ ] Maximum Wait Time: Display "X seconds" format
- [ ] Radio buttons: Vertical layout with proper spacing (space-y-2)
- [ ] Toggle switch: Proper container styling with rounded border and shadow

### Accessibility Compliance

Implement comprehensive accessibility features:

#### ARIA Labels and Relationships

```tsx
// Ensure proper ARIA relationships throughout the form
<FormItem>
  <FormLabel id="field-label">Field Name</FormLabel>
  <FormControl>
    <Input
      aria-labelledby="field-label"
      aria-describedby="field-description field-error"
    />
  </FormControl>
  <div id="field-description" className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
    Helper text description
  </div>
  <FormMessage id="field-error" />
</FormItem>
```

#### Keyboard Navigation

- [ ] All form controls are reachable via Tab navigation
- [ ] Slider component supports keyboard controls (Arrow keys)
- [ ] Radio group supports keyboard navigation (Arrow keys to switch options)
- [ ] Toggle switch supports Space bar activation
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible and consistent
- [ ] Tab order follows logical form progression

#### Screen Reader Support

- [ ] All form labels are properly associated with inputs
- [ ] Helper text is accessible via aria-describedby
- [ ] Error messages are announced when validation fails
- [ ] Form groups have proper heading structure for navigation
- [ ] Live regions announce dynamic value changes (slider, input counters)

### Responsive Design

Ensure proper behavior across device sizes:

#### Mobile Optimization (< 800px)

- [ ] Form groups stack properly on mobile devices
- [ ] Input widths adapt to content and screen size appropriately
- [ ] Slider component works correctly on touch devices
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44px)
- [ ] Text remains readable without horizontal scrolling

#### Tablet and Desktop

- [ ] Form maintains optimal width (max-w-[600px]) on larger screens
- [ ] Proper padding and margins maintain readability
- [ ] Radio buttons maintain proper spacing across screen sizes
- [ ] Toggle switch container adapts to available space

### Performance Optimization

Implement performance best practices:

```tsx
// Debounced validation for better performance
const debouncedValidation = useMemo(
  () => debounce((field: string, value: any) => {
    // Perform validation without blocking UI
  }, 300),
  []
)

// Prevent unnecessary re-renders
const formMemoized = useMemo(() => (
  // Form component implementation
), [form.formState.errors, form.watch()])
```

#### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Form renders in under 100ms on standard hardware
- [ ] Input interactions respond within 50ms
- [ ] Slider updates smoothly without visible lag
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders during normal usage
- [ ] Form validation is appropriately debounced (300ms)

### Error State Polish

Enhance error state presentation:

- [ ] Red borders appear immediately on invalid input
- [ ] Error messages use consistent styling and positioning
- [ ] Error icons (if any) are properly positioned and accessible
- [ ] Error states clear immediately when input becomes valid
- [ ] Multiple errors display without visual conflicts

### Integration Testing

Verify seamless integration with existing systems:

- [ ] Form styling matches other sections in the settings modal
- [ ] Form respects existing color theming and dark/light mode
- [ ] Form works within the existing modal layout constraints
- [ ] Form maintains scroll behavior within the settings content area
- [ ] Form doesn't interfere with modal keyboard navigation

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Consistency

- [ ] All measurements match specification exactly (24px title, 18px group headers, 13px helper text)
- [ ] Spacing between elements is consistent throughout the form
- [ ] Colors match the established design system (muted text, error states, etc.)
- [ ] Form groups have clear visual separation without being jarring
- [ ] Interactive elements have appropriate hover and focus states

### Accessibility Compliance

- [ ] Passes automated accessibility testing (axe-core or similar)
- [ ] Works correctly with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Focus management works correctly throughout the form
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards for all text

### Responsive Excellence

- [ ] Form works flawlessly on mobile devices (320px+)
- [ ] Touch interactions work correctly on all devices
- [ ] Form layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling required on any supported device
- [ ] Text scaling (browser zoom) works correctly up to 200%

### Performance Standards

- [ ] No performance regressions compared to placeholder mockups
- [ ] Form interactions feel instantaneous and responsive
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended interaction
- [ ] No console warnings or errors during normal usage

## Dependencies

- Requires completion of all previous form implementation tasks
- Final task in the General Settings implementation sequence
- Enables comprehensive end-to-end testing of the complete feature

## Security Considerations

- Accessibility features don't expose sensitive information inappropriately
- Performance optimizations don't compromise input validation
- Error messages provide helpful feedback without revealing system internals

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Comprehensive accessibility audit with automated and manual testing
- [ ] Cross-browser testing on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Device testing on various screen sizes and orientations
- [ ] Performance testing with Chrome DevTools profiling
- [ ] Visual regression testing to ensure pixel-perfect implementation
- [ ] End-to-end testing of complete user workflows
- [ ] Load testing to ensure form remains responsive under stress

### Log

**2025-07-27T23:34:13.156994Z** - Completed comprehensive accessibility, responsive behavior, and visual polish for the General Settings section. Enhanced form with WCAG 2.1 AA compliant accessibility features, responsive design optimizations, and exact visual specification compliance. All interactive elements now support full keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and meet touch target requirements. Form renders efficiently with live announcements for dynamic value changes and maintains visual consistency across all device sizes.
