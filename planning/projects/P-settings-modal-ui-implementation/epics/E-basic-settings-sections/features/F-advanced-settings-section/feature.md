# Advanced Settings Section Implementation

## Purpose and Goals

Replace the placeholder mockups in the Advanced Settings section with fully functional data management controls and developer options. Implement proper button styling, warning indicators, and toggle switches with appropriate visual hierarchy and safety considerations.

## Key Components to Implement

### Data Management Group

- **Export Settings Button**: Action button with proper styling and helper text
- **Import Settings Button**: File selection with validation and feedback
- **Clear All Conversations Button**: Destructive action with danger styling and warnings
- **Warning Text**: Prominent display of irreversible action warnings

### Developer Options Group

- **Debug Mode Toggle**: Toggle switch with clear labeling and description
- **Experimental Features Toggle**: Toggle with amber warning indicators
- **Warning Messages**: Appropriate color coding and prominence for risks

## Implementation Guidance

### Technical Approach

- Use shadcn/ui Button component with variants (secondary, destructive)
- Use shadcn/ui Toggle for developer option switches
- Implement proper button grid layout with CSS Grid or Flexbox
- Use Lucide React icons for visual enhancement
- Implement warning color system with CSS custom properties
- Prepare for future file handling functionality

### Component Architecture

```tsx
// Data Management group
<FormGroup title="Data Management">
  <ButtonGrid columns={3} stackOnMobile>
    <ActionButton
      variant="secondary"
      icon={<Download />}
      onClick={handleExport}
      helperText="Export settings as JSON file"
    >
      Export All Settings
    </ActionButton>

    <ActionButton
      variant="secondary"
      icon={<Upload />}
      onClick={handleImport}
      helperText="Import settings from JSON file"
    >
      Import Settings
    </ActionButton>

    <ActionButton
      variant="destructive"
      icon={<Trash2 />}
      onClick={handleClear}
      warningText="This cannot be undone"
    >
      Clear All Conversations
    </ActionButton>
  </ButtonGrid>
</FormGroup>

// Developer Options group
<FormGroup title="Developer Options">
  <ToggleField
    name="debugMode"
    label="Enable debug logging"
    helperText="Show detailed logs in developer console"
  />
  <ToggleField
    name="experimentalFeatures"
    label="Enable experimental features"
    warningText="May cause instability"
    warningIcon={<AlertTriangle />}
  />
</FormGroup>
```

### State Management

```tsx
interface AdvancedSettingsState {
  debugMode: boolean;
  experimentalFeatures: boolean;
  // Future: data management action states
  isExporting: boolean;
  isImporting: boolean;
  isClearing: boolean;
}
```

### Button Styling System

```tsx
// Custom button variants for advanced actions
const buttonVariants = {
  secondary: "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
  destructive:
    "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90",
};

// Warning text color system
const warningColors = {
  danger: "text-destructive",
  warning: "text-amber-600 dark:text-amber-400",
  muted: "text-muted-foreground",
};
```

### Validation Schema

```tsx
const AdvancedSettingsSchema = z.object({
  debugMode: z.boolean(),
  experimentalFeatures: z.boolean(),
});
```

## Testing Requirements

## Security Considerations

### Data Management Security

- Input validation for future import functionality
- Proper file type checking for settings import
- Secure handling of exported data
- User confirmation for destructive actions

### Developer Options Security

- No exposure of sensitive data in debug logs
- Safe defaults for all developer options

## Performance Requirements

- [ ] Buttons respond to interactions within 50ms
- [ ] Toggle switches provide immediate visual feedback

- CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive button layout
- Existing form validation and state management patterns
- Color system with warning and danger variants

## Integration Points

- Integrates with SettingsContent component structure

- Connects to future data export/import functionality
- Maintains consistency with other section styling
- Works with existing accessibility framework

## Future Functionality Preparation

### Export/Import Preparation

- Appropriate color coding for risk level
- Icon support for visual reinforcement

## Responsive Design Considerations

- [ ] Button grid stacks properly on mobile devices
