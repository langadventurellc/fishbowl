# Keyboard Navigation and Accessibility

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation and accessibility features for the settings modal, ensuring full keyboard operability, proper focus management, screen reader support, and WCAG compliance. This feature makes the settings modal accessible to users with disabilities and provides efficient keyboard-driven navigation for power users.

## Settings Modal UI Specification

**IMPORTANT: Before beginning work on this feature, you MUST read and reference `docs/specifications/settings-modal-ui-spec.md`.** This document contains detailed design and functional requirements for the settings modal, including exact dimensions, layout specifications, navigation structure, content sections, and user experience considerations. All implementation work should follow the specifications outlined in this document. If you have questions about requirements, consult this specification first as it likely contains the answer.

## Key Components to Implement

### Focus Management System

- Implement focus trap within modal when open to prevent focus escape
- Establish proper focus restoration when modal closes
- Create logical tab order for all interactive elements
- Handle focus management for dynamic content and sub-navigation

### Keyboard Navigation Controls

- Implement Arrow key navigation between navigation items
- Add Enter/Space key activation for buttons and navigation items
- Support Escape key for modal closing and navigation back actions
- Add Tab key navigation through form elements and interactive components

### Screen Reader Support

- Implement proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Add ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates
- Provide ARIA descriptions for navigation structure and modal purpose
- Ensure screen reader announces navigation changes and modal state

### Accessibility Standards Compliance

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for keyboard accessibility
- Implement proper color contrast ratios for all text and interactive elements
- Provide clear visual focus indicators for all focusable elements
- Ensure all functionality is operable via keyboard alone

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Focus Trap Implementation

- [ ] When modal opens, focus moves to first focusable element (close button or first navigation item)
- [ ] Tab and Shift+Tab navigation contained within modal boundaries
- [ ] Focus cannot escape modal while it's open
- [ ] When modal closes, focus returns to element that triggered modal opening
- [ ] Focus trap works correctly with dynamic content changes

### Keyboard Navigation Implementation

- [ ] Arrow keys (Up/Down) navigate between navigation items
- [ ] Enter key activates focused navigation item or button
- [ ] Space key activates buttons and toggles
- [ ] Escape key closes modal from any focused element
- [ ] Tab key moves through form elements in logical order
- [ ] Shift+Tab moves backward through focusable elements

### Advanced Keyboard Shortcuts

- [ ] Cmd/Ctrl+S saves changes (when Save button is enabled)
- [ ] Arrow keys (Left/Right) navigate between sub-tabs when applicable
- [ ] Home/End keys jump to first/last navigation item
- [ ] Page Up/Page Down scroll content area when focused
- [ ] Alt+1-9 navigate directly to numbered sections (optional enhancement)

### Screen Reader Support

- [ ] Modal announced as "Settings dialog" when opened
- [ ] Navigation structure announced as "Navigation menu" with item count
- [ ] Active section announced when navigation changes
- [ ] Form labels properly associated with input elements
- [ ] Error messages announced immediately when validation fails
- [ ] Loading states announced for dynamic content

### ARIA Implementation

- [ ] Modal has role="dialog" and aria-labelledby pointing to title
- [ ] Navigation has role="navigation" and aria-label="Settings sections"
- [ ] Navigation items have proper aria-current for active state
- [ ] Buttons have descriptive aria-label when text alone is insufficient
- [ ] Form elements have proper aria-describedby for help text
- [ ] Dynamic content uses aria-live regions for announcements

### Visual Focus Indicators

- [ ] All focusable elements have visible focus outline
- [ ] Focus outline meets 3:1 contrast ratio requirement
- [ ] Focus outline is at least 2px wide for visibility
- [ ] Focus indicators work correctly in both light and dark themes
- [ ] Focus outline doesn't obscure element content or adjacent elements

### Color and Contrast Compliance

- [ ] All text meets 4.5:1 contrast ratio for AA compliance
- [ ] Large text (18px+) meets 3:1 contrast ratio requirement
- [ ] Interactive elements meet 3:1 contrast ratio against background
- [ ] Color is not the only means of conveying information
- [ ] Focus indicators meet contrast requirements

## Implementation Guidance

### Technical Approach

- Use React's `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks for focus management
- Implement custom hooks for keyboard event handling and focus trap
- Use `aria-*` attributes extensively for screen reader support
- Follow WAI-ARIA design patterns for dialog and navigation components
- Test with actual screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) during development

### Focus Management Implementation

```typescript
// Custom hook for focus trap
const useFocusTrap = (isActive: boolean) => {
  const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const previousFocusRef = useRef<HTMLElement | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isActive) return;

    // Store previous focus
    previousFocusRef.current = document.activeElement as HTMLElement;

    // Focus first element
    const firstFocusable = containerRef.current?.querySelector(
      'button, [href], input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])',
    ) as HTMLElement;
    firstFocusable?.focus();

    return () => {
      // Restore previous focus
      previousFocusRef.current?.focus();
    };
  }, [isActive]);

  return containerRef;
};
```

### Keyboard Navigation Hook

```typescript
const useKeyboardNavigation = (
  navigationItems: string[],
  activeSection: string,
  onSectionChange: (section: string) => void,
) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
      const currentIndex = navigationItems.indexOf(activeSection);

      switch (event.key) {
        case "ArrowDown":
          event.preventDefault();
          const nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % navigationItems.length;
          onSectionChange(navigationItems[nextIndex]);
          break;

        case "ArrowUp":
          event.preventDefault();
          const prevIndex =
            (currentIndex - 1 + navigationItems.length) %
            navigationItems.length;
          onSectionChange(navigationItems[prevIndex]);
          break;

        case "Home":
          event.preventDefault();
          onSectionChange(navigationItems[0]);
          break;

        case "End":
          event.preventDefault();
          onSectionChange(navigationItems[navigationItems.length - 1]);
          break;
      }
    };

    document.addEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
    return () => document.removeEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
  }, [navigationItems, activeSection, onSectionChange]);
};
```

### ARIA Implementation Example

```tsx
<Dialog
  role="dialog"
  aria-labelledby="settings-title"
  aria-describedby="settings-description"
>
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogHeader>
      <DialogTitle id="settings-title">Settings</DialogTitle>
      <div id="settings-description" className="sr-only">
        Configure application settings and preferences
      </div>
    </DialogHeader>

    <nav role="navigation" aria-label="Settings sections">
      <ul role="list">
        {navigationItems.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            <button
              aria-current={activeSection === item.id ? "page" : undefined}
              onClick={() => onSectionChange(item.id)}
            >
              {item.label}
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

- Screen reader announcements don't delay interface responsiveness
- Accessibility calculations don't impact application performance

### Memory and Resource Usage

- Focus trap event listeners properly cleaned up
- Keyboard event handlers don't create memory leaks
- ARIA live regions managed efficiently
