# Modal Shell Testing Implementation

## Context

Create comprehensive test coverage for all modal shell components and their integration, including layout testing, responsive behavior, accessibility compliance, and user interaction flows.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing for Individual Components

#### ModalHeader Component Tests

- Component rendering with correct dimensions (50px height)
- Title display with proper styling and positioning
- Close button functionality and event handling
- Zustand store integration for close actions
- Accessibility attributes and keyboard navigation
- Hover and focus state behavior

#### ModalFooter Component Tests

- Component rendering with correct dimensions (60px height)
- Button placement and spacing (Cancel/Save, 10px gap)
- Button state management (enabled/disabled)
- Zustand store integration for actions
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Different prop combinations and edge cases

#### Navigation Panel Enhancement Tests

- Navigation item rendering with exact specifications (40px height)
- Interactive state transitions (default/hover/active)
- Sub-navigation functionality for applicable sections
- Responsive behavior at different breakpoints
- Zustand store integration for navigation state
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility

### 2. Integration Testing

#### Complete Modal Shell Integration

- Header + Body + Footer layout structure
- Component communication and state flow
- Responsive layout behavior across breakpoints
- State synchronization between components
- Event propagation and handling

#### Two-Panel Layout Integration

- Navigation panel and content area proportions
- Responsive width changes at breakpoints
- Visual separation (borders) between panels
- Scroll behavior in both panels
- Content area maximum width constraints

### 3. Layout and Responsive Testing

#### Breakpoint Testing

- **Large screens** (≥ 1000px): Full layout with 200px navigation
- **Medium screens** (< 1000px): 95% modal width, 180px navigation
- **Small screens** (< 800px): Collapsible navigation, full-width content

#### Layout Calculations

- Modal dimensions and centering
- Panel width calculations and responsiveness
- Content area padding adjustments
- Header and footer positioning

### 4. Accessibility Testing

#### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

- Keyboard navigation flow through all components
- Screen reader compatibility and ARIA attributes
- Focus management and visual focus indicators
- Color contrast requirements
- Text alternatives and descriptions

#### Interactive Element Testing

- Tab order through header, navigation, content, footer
- Enter/Space activation for buttons and navigation items
- Escape key modal closing functionality
- Arrow key navigation within navigation panel

### 5. Visual Regression Testing

#### Component Appearance

- Header styling and typography accuracy
- Navigation item states and styling
- Footer button appearance and alignment
- Modal shell overall appearance

#### Responsive Visual Testing

- Layout appearance at all breakpoints
- Component positioning and sizing
- Visual separation and borders
- Typography and spacing consistency

### 6. Performance Testing

#### Rendering Performance

- Modal opening and closing performance
- Component re-rendering efficiency
- Layout calculation performance
- State update performance across components

#### Memory Usage

- Component memory footprint
- State management overhead
- Event listener cleanup
- Modal lifecycle memory management

## Test Implementation Requirements

### Test Structure

```
apps/desktop/src/components/settings/__tests__/
├── ModalHeader.test.tsx
├── ModalFooter.test.tsx
├── SettingsNavigation.test.tsx
├── SettingsModal.integration.test.tsx
├── responsive-layout.test.tsx
├── accessibility.test.tsx
└── performance.test.tsx
```

### Testing Tools and Libraries

- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Additional Jest matchers
- **@testing-library/user-event**: User interaction simulation
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing for complex scenarios

### Mock Requirements

- Zustand store mocking for state management testing
- Window resize mocking for responsive testing
- Intersection Observer mocking for scroll testing
- Timer mocking for animation and transition testing

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All modal shell components have >90% test coverage
- [ ] Integration tests cover complete modal shell functionality
- [ ] Responsive tests verify layout at all specified breakpoints
- [ ] Accessibility tests confirm WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Visual regression tests prevent styling regressions
- [ ] Performance tests ensure efficient rendering and interactions
- [ ] End-to-end tests cover complete user interaction flows

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Component Unit Tests

- Test component rendering with various props
- Test event handlers and state changes
- Test Zustand store integration
- Test accessibility attributes and behavior

### 2. Integration Test Setup

- Mock complete modal environment
- Test component interaction and communication
- Test state flow across multiple components
- Test responsive behavior integration

### 3. Accessibility Test Implementation

- Use @testing-library/jest-dom for accessibility assertions
- Test keyboard navigation flows
- Test screen reader compatibility
- Test focus management

### 4. Visual Regression Setup

- Configure screenshot testing for component appearance
- Test appearance at multiple breakpoints
- Test interactive state appearance
- Test theme compatibility

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: All modal shell components must be implemented
- **Prerequisite**: Modal shell integration must be complete
- Must use existing testing infrastructure
- Must integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Test Data and Scenarios

### Test Scenarios

- Modal opening and closing flows
- Navigation between different settings sections
- Sub-navigation functionality
- Responsive behavior transitions
- Error handling and edge cases
- Accessibility workflows

### Mock Data

- Settings sections and navigation structure
- User state and preferences
- API responses for testing integration
- Error states and loading states

## Continuous Integration

- All tests must pass before code merge
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Accessibility compliance must be verified
- Visual regression tests must pass

## Maintenance and Updates

- Test updates required when specifications change
- Regular accessibility audit testing
- Performance benchmark updates
- Documentation updates for test procedures
