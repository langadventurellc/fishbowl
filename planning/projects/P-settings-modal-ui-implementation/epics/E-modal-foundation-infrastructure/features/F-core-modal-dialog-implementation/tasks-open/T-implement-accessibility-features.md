# Implement Accessibility Features and Keyboard Navigation

## Context

Ensure the modal meets accessibility standards and provides excellent keyboard navigation experience. This includes proper ARIA attributes, focus management, and screen reader support as specified in the feature requirements. No automated tests should be created for this task.

## Technical Approach

Leverage shadcn/ui Dialog's built-in accessibility features while adding custom enhancements for the settings modal specific requirements. Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Focus Management

- Establish focus trap within modal when opened
- Return focus to trigger element when modal closes
- Implement logical tab order within modal content
- Handle focus for dynamically added content

### ARIA Attributes

- Verify `aria-labelledby` points to modal title
- Implement `aria-describedby` for modal description
- Add `role="dialog"` if not provided by Radix
- Ensure proper `aria-modal="true"` attribute

### Keyboard Navigation

- ESC key closes modal (verify Radix default behavior)
- Tab navigation cycles within modal (focus trap)
- Shift+Tab for reverse navigation
- Enter/Space on focusable elements works correctly

### Screen Reader Support

- Modal announced properly when opened
- Title and description read by screen readers
- Status changes communicated appropriately
- Proper semantic structure for modal content

### Visual Focus Indicators

- Clear focus outlines for keyboard navigation
- High contrast focus indicators
- Consistent focus styling across modal elements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Focus trap established within modal when open
- [ ] Focus returns to trigger element when modal closes
- [ ] ESC key closes modal consistently
- [ ] Tab navigation cycles properly within modal
- [ ] ARIA labels properly reference modal title (aria-labelledby)
- [ ] ARIA description properly references modal content (aria-describedby)
- [ ] Modal announced to screen readers when opened
- [ ] Screen reader can navigate all modal content
- [ ] Focus indicators visible and high contrast
- [ ] Modal marked with proper aria-modal="true"
- [ ] Keyboard navigation doesn't escape modal bounds
- [ ] All interactive elements accessible via keyboard

## Security Considerations

- Prevent focus escape that could lead to security bypass
- Ensure ARIA attributes don't expose sensitive information
- Validate focus management doesn't create security vulnerabilities
- Implement proper keyboard event sanitization

## Performance Requirements

- Focus management operations complete within 100ms
- No performance impact on keyboard event handling
- Efficient screen reader content updates
- Smooth focus transitions between elements

## Files Modified

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsModal.tsx` (accessibility enhancements)
- Add custom focus management utilities if needed
- Update CSS for focus indicators

## Dependencies

- Requires T-create-settingsmodal-component to be completed
- Uses shadcn/ui Dialog accessibility features as foundation
- May require additional ARIA utilities

## WCAG Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Modal meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet minimum requirements
- [ ] All functionality available via keyboard
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verified
- [ ] Focus management follows best practices
