# Implement Modal Overlay Behavior and Z-Index Management

## Context

Ensure the modal overlay provides proper visual separation from background content and implements correct stacking behavior. The overlay must prevent interaction with background elements while maintaining proper visual hierarchy.

## Technical Approach

Customize the shadcn/ui Dialog overlay to meet specific styling requirements and implement robust z-index management that works consistently across the application.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Overlay Styling Implementation

- Semi-transparent overlay with `bg-black/50` (50% opacity)
- Full viewport coverage using `fixed inset-0`
- Proper z-index management (z-50 or higher)
- Smooth fade in/out animations during modal open/close

### Z-Index Strategy

- Modal overlay: `z-50`
- Modal content: `z-50` or higher (above overlay)
- Ensure modal stack is above all application content
- Handle edge cases with existing high z-index elements

### Click-to-Close Behavior

- Verify overlay click closes modal (default Radix behavior)
- Ensure clicks on modal content don't bubble to overlay
- Test edge cases around modal boundaries

### Animation Performance

- Smooth overlay fade animations
- No layout shift during modal open/close
- Proper animation cleanup on component unmount

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Semi-transparent overlay covers entire viewport
- [ ] Overlay opacity exactly 50% (`bg-black/50`)
- [ ] Overlay prevents interaction with background elements
- [ ] Z-index properly stacks modal above all content (z-50+)
- [ ] Clicking overlay closes modal (default behavior maintained)
- [ ] Clicking modal content does not close modal
- [ ] Smooth fade in/out animations work correctly
- [ ] No layout thrashing during modal operations
- [ ] Modal stacking works with other application overlays
- [ ] Overlay behavior consistent across different browsers

## Security Considerations

- Prevent click-jacking by ensuring overlay fully covers viewport
- Validate z-index values to prevent malicious stacking manipulation
- Ensure proper event handling prevents modal bypass

## Testing Requirements

- Test overlay click-to-close behavior
- Verify z-index stacking with various application states
- Test animation performance across different devices
- Verify overlay prevents background interaction
- Test modal behavior with multiple overlays
- Cross-browser testing for overlay rendering
- Performance testing for animation smoothness

## Performance Requirements

- Overlay animations complete within 200ms
- No performance degradation with overlay interactions
- Efficient event handling for overlay clicks
- Proper memory cleanup of animation resources

## Files Modified

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsModal.tsx` (overlay customization)
- Custom CSS for z-index management if needed
- Any global CSS that affects modal stacking

## Dependencies

- Requires T-create-settingsmodal-component to be completed
- Uses shadcn/ui Dialog overlay implementation as base
