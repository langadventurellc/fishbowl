# Create Comprehensive Test Suite for Modal Functionality

## Context

Develop a complete test suite that validates all aspects of the modal implementation including dimensions, positioning, accessibility, responsive behavior, and user interactions. This ensures the modal meets all feature requirements and maintains quality standards.

## Technical Approach

Create unit tests, integration tests, and visual regression tests using Jest, React Testing Library, and potentially Playwright for end-to-end scenarios. Cover all acceptance criteria from the feature specification.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Unit Test Coverage

Create `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/__tests__/SettingsModal.test.tsx`:

- Modal rendering and basic functionality
- Props handling (open/onOpenChange)
- Component structure and DOM output
- Event handling (escape key, overlay click)

### Dimension and Positioning Tests

- Test modal dimensions at different viewport sizes
- Verify centering behavior (horizontal and vertical)
- Test min/max width and height constraints
- Validate border radius and shadow styling

### Accessibility Testing

- Screen reader compatibility tests
- Focus management verification
- ARIA attributes testing
- Keyboard navigation testing

### Responsive Behavior Tests

- Test breakpoint behavior at different screen sizes
- Verify responsive dimension calculations
- Test mobile-specific optimizations
- Validate smooth transitions between breakpoints

### Integration Testing

Create integration tests for:

- Modal opening and closing flows
- State management integration
- Parent-child component interactions
- Real user interaction scenarios

### Visual Regression Testing

- Screenshot comparisons for consistent visual output
- Cross-browser rendering verification
- Responsive layout visual validation

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests

```typescript
describe("SettingsModal", () => {
  describe("Rendering", () => {
    test("renders modal when open prop is true");
    test("does not render modal when open prop is false");
    test("applies correct CSS classes for dimensions");
  });

  describe("Interactions", () => {
    test("calls onOpenChange when escape key pressed");
    test("calls onOpenChange when overlay clicked");
    test("does not close when modal content clicked");
  });

  describe("Accessibility", () => {
    test("traps focus within modal when open");
    test("returns focus to trigger when closed");
    test("has proper ARIA attributes");
  });

  describe("Responsive", () => {
    test("applies correct dimensions for large screens");
    test("applies mobile optimizations for small screens");
    test("maintains centering across breakpoints");
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```typescript
describe("SettingsModal Integration", () => {
  test("complete modal open/close workflow");
  test("keyboard navigation through modal content");
  test("modal interaction with parent components");
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests cover all modal component functionality
- [ ] Tests verify correct dimensions (80% viewport, max 1000px, min 800px width)
- [ ] Tests validate perfect centering behavior
- [ ] Border radius (8px) and shadow styling tested
- [ ] Overlay behavior tests (click-to-close, z-index)
- [ ] Accessibility tests for focus management and ARIA attributes
- [ ] Keyboard navigation tests (ESC, Tab, Shift+Tab)
- [ ] Responsive behavior tests for all breakpoints
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tests
- [ ] Performance tests for animation smoothness
- [ ] Test coverage ≥90% for modal component
- [ ] All tests pass consistently in CI/CD pipeline

## Security Testing

- Input validation tests for modal props
- XSS prevention tests for modal content
- Focus trap security tests
- Event handling security validation

## Performance Testing

- Modal open/close animation performance
- Memory leak detection during repeated operations
- Responsive transition performance
- Resource cleanup verification

## Testing Tools and Setup

- Jest for unit testing framework
- React Testing Library for component testing
- jest-axe for accessibility testing
- @testing-library/user-event for interaction simulation
- Potentially Playwright for E2E testing

## Files Created

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/__tests__/SettingsModal.test.tsx`
- Test utilities and helpers as needed
- Mock implementations for dependencies
- Test configuration updates

## Dependencies

- Requires T-implement-accessibility-features to be completed
- Requires T-add-responsive-design to be completed
- Uses Jest and React Testing Library setup from project

## Test Coverage Goals

- Unit tests: ≥95% code coverage
- Integration tests: All user workflows covered
- Accessibility tests: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- Cross-browser tests: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Performance tests: All animation benchmarks met
