# Install and Setup shadcn/ui Dialog Component

## Context

This task establishes the foundational Dialog component from shadcn/ui that will serve as the base for the settings modal. The feature requires precise customization of dimensions, positioning, and styling as specified in the UI requirements.

## Technical Approach

1. Install the Dialog component using the shadcn/ui CLI
2. Verify all required Dialog sub-components are available
3. Ensure proper TypeScript integration
4. Validate component structure matches project patterns

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Installation

- Run `npx shadcn@latest add dialog` to install the component
- Verify installation created `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`
- Check that all Dialog sub-components are properly exported:
  - Dialog, DialogContent, DialogDescription, DialogHeader
  - DialogTitle, DialogTrigger, DialogFooter, DialogClose, DialogOverlay

### Verification

- Ensure @radix-ui/react-dialog dependency is properly installed
- Verify TypeScript types are correctly imported and available
- Test basic Dialog functionality with a simple test component
- Confirm component follows project's existing UI component patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dialog component successfully installed via shadcn/ui CLI
- [ ] All Dialog sub-components properly exported and typed
- [ ] @radix-ui/react-dialog dependency correctly installed
- [ ] Basic Dialog renders without errors in development environment
- [ ] Component structure matches existing shadcn/ui components in project
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with no errors related to Dialog imports

## Security Considerations

- Validate that no malicious code was introduced during component installation
- Ensure proper sanitization of Dialog content will be available for future use
- Verify Dialog component includes proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Testing Requirements

- Create a basic test to verify Dialog component renders correctly
- Test that Dialog can be opened and closed programmatically
- Verify all imported Dialog sub-components are accessible and functional
- Ensure no console errors or warnings appear during Dialog operations

## Files Created/Modified

- `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` (created)
- `package.json` (updated with new dependencies)
- Any shadcn/ui configuration files updated during installation

## Dependencies

- None - This is the foundational task for the modal implementation
