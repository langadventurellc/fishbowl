# Core Modal Dialog Implementation

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement and customize the shadcn/ui Dialog component to create the foundational modal infrastructure for the settings interface. This feature establishes the core dialog functionality with proper dimensions, positioning, styling, and overlay behavior as specified in the UI requirements.

## Key Components to Implement

### shadcn/ui Dialog Integration

- Add shadcn/ui Dialog component to the project using `npx shadcn@latest add dialog`
- Import Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogTrigger, DialogFooter components
- Customize Dialog component for desktop application requirements

### Modal Container Structure

- Implement custom DialogContent with precise dimensions (80% viewport, max 1000px, min 800px width; max 700px, min 500px height)
- Configure centered positioning with proper viewport calculations
- Apply custom styling: 8px border radius, shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)
- Implement semi-transparent overlay with proper z-index management (z-50)

### Dialog Customization

- Override default shadcn/ui Dialog styling to match design specifications
- Implement responsive behavior for different screen sizes
- Configure proper modal behavior (close on overlay click, escape key handling)
- Ensure proper focus management and accessibility attributes

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Modal Dimensions and Positioning

- [ ] Modal width: 80% of viewport width, maximum 1000px, minimum 800px
- [ ] Modal height: 80% of viewport height, maximum 700px, minimum 500px
- [ ] Modal is perfectly centered both horizontally and vertically in viewport
- [ ] Centering maintained when browser window is resized
- [ ] Border radius of exactly 8px applied to modal container
- [ ] Box shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) properly rendered

### Overlay and Z-Index Management

- [ ] Semi-transparent overlay (bg-black/50) covers entire viewport
- [ ] Modal container has z-index above all other content (z-50+)
- [ ] Overlay prevents interaction with background elements
- [ ] Clicking overlay closes modal (default Radix behavior)
- [ ] Proper stacking context established for modal and overlay

### Dialog Component Integration

- [ ] shadcn/ui Dialog component successfully installed via CLI
- [ ] All necessary Dialog sub-components imported (Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, etc.)
- [ ] Dialog components properly typed with TypeScript
- [ ] Dialog integrates seamlessly with existing project structure
- [ ] Dialog component follows project's component organization patterns

### Responsive Behavior

- [ ] On screens < 1000px: Modal takes 95% width, navigation panel 180px
- [ ] On screens < 800px: Navigation becomes collapsible, full width content area
- [ ] Modal maintains proper proportions across different screen sizes
- [ ] Text and interactive elements remain accessible on narrow screens
- [ ] Modal never exceeds viewport boundaries

### Accessibility and Interaction

- [ ] Focus trap established within modal when open
- [ ] Escape key closes modal
- [ ] Proper ARIA labels applied for screen readers (aria-labelledby, aria-describedby)
- [ ] Focus returns to trigger element when modal closes
- [ ] Modal announced properly to screen readers when opened
- [ ] Keyboard navigation ready for content sections

## Implementation Guidance

### Technical Approach

- Use shadcn/ui Dialog as base component, customize with className overrides
- Implement custom CSS classes for precise dimension control
- Utilize Tailwind CSS utilities for responsive behavior
- Follow existing project patterns in `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/` directory
- Ensure TypeScript types are properly defined for all Dialog components

### Component Structure

```tsx
// Basic structure following shadcn/ui patterns
<Dialog open={isOpen} onOpenChange={setIsOpen}>
  <DialogContent className="settings-modal-content">
    <DialogHeader className="settings-modal-header">
      <DialogTitle>Settings</DialogTitle>
    </DialogHeader>
    {/* Content area will be implemented in subsequent features */}
    <DialogFooter className="settings-modal-footer">
      {/* Footer buttons will be implemented in modal shell feature */}
    </DialogFooter>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

### File Organization

- Create `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsModal.tsx` for main modal component
- Add custom styles in component-specific CSS or Tailwind classes
- Ensure dialog component is properly exported for use in main application

## Testing Requirements

### Visual Testing

- [ ] Modal renders with correct dimensions on different screen sizes (1920x1080, 1366x768, 1024x768)
- [ ] Modal positioning remains centered during window resize
- [ ] Shadow and border radius render correctly across different browsers
- [ ] Overlay opacity and color match specifications

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation

- Validate modal dimensions to prevent CSS injection
- Ensure proper sanitization of any dynamic content within modal
- Implement proper escape handling for modal content

### Accessibility Security

- Prevent focus escape from modal when open
- Ensure proper screen reader announcements don't leak sensitive information
- Implement proper keyboard navigation without security vulnerabilities

## Performance Requirements

### Rendering Performance

- Modal open/close animation completes within 200ms
- No layout thrashing during modal open/resize operations
- Smooth animation performance on lower-end hardware
- Memory usage remains stable during repeated open/close operations

### Resource Management

- Proper cleanup of event listeners when modal unmounts
- No memory leaks from animation frames or timers
- Efficient re-rendering when modal dimensions change
- Optimized CSS for smooth animations

## Dependencies on Other Features

- **None** - This is the foundational feature that other modal features will build upon
- Provides the base Dialog component that will be enhanced by:
  - State Management System (for open/close state)
  - Modal Shell Structure (for header/footer content)
  - Keyboard Navigation (for enhanced accessibility)

## Integration Points

### With Future Features

- Modal shell will add header/footer content to this Dialog foundation
- State management will control the `open` and `onOpenChange` props
- Electron integration will trigger modal opening via IPC
- Keyboard navigation will enhance the basic accessibility provided here

### With Existing Codebase

- Integrates with existing shadcn/ui components in `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/`
- Follows established TypeScript patterns in the desktop application
- Uses existing Tailwind CSS configuration and design tokens
- Maintains consistency with other modal/dialog usage in the application
