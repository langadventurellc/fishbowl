# Add Responsive Design Implementation for Different Screen Sizes

## Context

Implement responsive behavior to ensure the modal works effectively across different screen sizes, from large desktop displays to smaller laptop screens. The modal must maintain usability and visual hierarchy at all viewport sizes. No automated tests should be created for this task.

## Technical Approach

Use Tailwind CSS responsive utilities and custom CSS to implement the specific breakpoint behavior defined in the feature requirements. Ensure smooth transitions between different responsive states.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Breakpoint Implementation

- Large screens (≥1000px): Standard modal dimensions (80% viewport, max 1000px)
- Medium screens (<1000px): Modal takes 95% width, navigation panel 180px
- Small screens (<800px): Navigation becomes collapsible, full width content area
- Extra small screens: Ensure minimum usable dimensions maintained

### Responsive Dimension Logic

```css
/* Large screens - standard behavior */
@media (min-width: 1000px) {
  width: 80vw;
  max-width: 1000px;
  min-width: 800px;
}

/* Medium screens - adjusted width */
@media (max-width: 999px) {
  width: 95vw;
  min-width: 300px;
}

/* Small screens - mobile optimized */
@media (max-width: 799px) {
  width: 95vw;
  height: 90vh;
  min-width: 280px;
}
```

### Content Responsiveness

- Text remains readable at all screen sizes
- Interactive elements maintain proper touch targets (44px minimum)
- Modal content scrollable when needed
- Navigation elements adapt properly

### Performance Optimization

- Use CSS transforms for smooth responsive transitions
- Minimize layout recalculations during resize
- Efficient media query organization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] On screens ≥1000px: Standard modal dimensions (80% viewport, max 1000px, min 800px)
- [ ] On screens <1000px: Modal takes 95% width with minimum 300px
- [ ] On screens <800px: Modal optimized for mobile use (95% width, 90% height)
- [ ] Text remains readable and well-sized at all breakpoints
- [ ] Interactive elements maintain proper touch targets (≥44px)
- [ ] Modal never exceeds viewport boundaries at any screen size
- [ ] Smooth transitions between responsive states
- [ ] Modal centering maintained across all breakpoints
- [ ] Content scrollable when modal height exceeds viewport
- [ ] No horizontal scrollbars appear at any breakpoint

## Security Considerations

- Validate responsive dimensions to prevent CSS injection
- Ensure modal boundaries are properly maintained at all sizes
- Prevent content overflow that could hide important UI elements

## Performance Requirements

- Responsive transitions complete within 300ms
- No layout thrashing during viewport changes
- Efficient media query processing
- Smooth performance during continuous resize

## Files Modified

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsModal.tsx` (responsive styling)
- Custom CSS/Tailwind classes for responsive behavior
- Media query definitions for modal responsiveness

## Dependencies

- Requires T-implement-modal-overlay-behavior to be completed
- Uses Tailwind CSS responsive utilities
- May require custom CSS for complex responsive logic

### Log

**2025-07-26T16:53:06.739292Z** - Implemented comprehensive responsive design for settings modal with navigation panel that adapts to screen sizes. Added collapsible navigation at <800px breakpoint and 180px width at <1000px breakpoint. Created SettingsNavigation and SettingsContent components with full placeholder content for all settings sections. All responsive behaviors working correctly with proper accessibility features and keyboard navigation.
