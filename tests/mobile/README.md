# Mobile E2E Tests (Future)

This directory is reserved for future mobile end-to-end tests.

## Current Status

Mobile testing infrastructure has been removed as the mobile app is currently on hold while waiting for Tauri Mobile to mature.

## Future Plans

When mobile support is implemented (likely with Tauri Mobile), this directory will contain:

- E2E test suites for mobile functionality
- Mobile-specific test utilities and helpers
- Configuration for mobile testing frameworks

The desktop E2E testing patterns in `tests/desktop/` can serve as a reference for implementing mobile tests when needed.
