# Instructions for working in the Fishbowl Monorepo

A desktop and mobile application for creating conversations with multiple AI agents simultaneously. Configure agents with unique personalities, roles, and AI models to enable dynamic brainstorming, problem-solving, and creative exploration.

## Development

See [Architecture Guide](docs/architecture/monorepo.md) for the overall structure and guidelines.

## Architecture

How to structure code across shared packages and platform-specific applications. It is designed to ensure clean separations of concerns, maintainability, and reusability of code. The monorepo contains projects for both desktop (Tauri) and mobile (React Native) platforms, with shared logic in a common package.

### Technology Stack

- **Desktop**: Tauri with React
- **Mobile**: React Native with Expo
- **Shared Logic**: TypeScript, Zustand for state management, custom hooks
- **Unit Testing**: Jest
- **BDD Testing**: Jest + tauri-driver + WebdriverIO for Tauri, Jest + Detox for React Native
- **Database**: SQLite (tauri-plugin-sql for Tauri, expo-sqlite for React Native)
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Styling**: Tailwind and shadcn/ui for Tauri, NativeWind and Tamagui for React Native

### 1. Code Placement Rules

- **Shared Package (`@your-app/shared`)**: Business logic, API clients, hooks, stores, types, utils
- **Platform Apps**: ONLY UI components and platform-specific code
- **No UI in shared packages**: React Native and web React components are incompatible

### 2. What Can Be Shared

‚úÖ **CAN Share:**

- Business logic and algorithms
- API clients and network code
- State management (Zustand stores)
- Custom hooks (logic only)
- TypeScript types/interfaces
- Utility functions
- Constants and configuration

‚ùå **CANNOT Share:**

- UI components (View vs div, Text vs span)
- Styles (StyleSheet vs CSS)
- Navigation (React Navigation vs React Router)
- Platform-specific APIs

### 4. Import Rules

- Always use workspace protocol: `"@your-app/shared": "workspace:*"`
- Import from package names, not relative paths across packages
- Use barrel exports in shared packages

### 5. Platform Bridges

For platform-specific features, use the bridge pattern:

```typescript
// In shared package - define interface
export interface StorageBridge {
  get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null>;
  set<T>(key: string, value: T): Promise<void>;
}

// In platform apps - implement
// Desktop: uses localStorage
// Mobile: uses AsyncStorage
```

### 7. Testing Strategy

- Shared package: Unit tests for business logic (Vitest)
- Platform apps: Component/integration tests
- Keep platform-specific test utilities separate

### 8. Environment Variables

- Desktop: Use Vite env vars (`VITE_API_URL`)
- Mobile: Use React Native Config or process.env
- Abstract in shared config module

## Quick Reference for AI Agents

When adding features:

1. **Business logic** ‚Üí `packages/shared/src/`
2. **Desktop UI** ‚Üí `apps/desktop/src/`
3. **Mobile UI** ‚Üí `apps/mobile/src/`
4. **Shared types** ‚Üí `packages/shared/src/types/`
5. **API calls** ‚Üí `packages/shared/src/api/`

Never put UI components in shared packages. Always keep platform-specific code in the respective app directories.

## Clean‚ÄëCode Charter

> **Purpose** Guide large‚Äëlanguage‚Äëmodel (LLM) coding agents toward the simplest **working** solution, written in the style of seasoned engineers (Kent Beck, Robert Martin, et‚ÄØal.).
> The charter is language‚Äëagnostic but assumes most code is authored in **Python**.

### 1 Guiding Maxims (agents must echo these before coding)

| Maxim                                  | Practical test                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **KISS** - _Keep It Super Simple_      | Could a junior dev explain the design to a peer in ‚â§‚ÄØ2‚ÄØmin?         |
| **YAGNI** - _You Aren't Gonna Need It_ | Is the abstraction used <‚ÄØ3‚ÄØtimes? If so, inline it.                |
| **SRP / small units**                  | One concept per function; ‚â§‚ÄØ20 logical LOC; cyclomatic ‚â§‚ÄØ5.         |
| **DRY** - _Don't Repeat Yourself_      | Is the code repeated in ‚â•‚ÄØ2 places? If so, extract it.              |
| **Simplicity**                         | Is the code simpler than the alternative? If not, refactor it.      |
| **Explicit is better than implicit**   | Is the code self‚Äëdocumenting? If not, add comments.                 |
| **Fail fast**                          | Does the code handle errors gracefully? If not, add error handling. |

### 2 Architecture Heuristics

#### 2.1 File‚Äë & package‚Äëlevel

- **‚â§‚ÄØ400 LOC per file** (logical lines).
- No **"util" or "helpers" dumping grounds** - every module owns a domain noun/verb.

#### 2.2 Module decomposition & dependency rules _(new)_

1. **Domain‚Äëoriented modules.** Each module encapsulates **one** coherent business concept (noun) or service (verb).
2. **Explicit public surface.** Export `index.ts` only what callers need; everything else is private.
3. **Acyclic dependency graph.** Imports must not form cycles; prefer dependency‚Äëinversion interfaces to break loops.
4. **Shallow import depth ‚â§‚ÄØ3.** Deep chains signal hidden coupling.
5. **Rule of three for new layers.** Add a new package level only after three modules share the same concern.
6. **Composition over inheritance** unless ‚â•‚ÄØ2 concrete subclasses are already required.
7. **Ports & Adapters pattern** for I/O: keep domain logic free of external frameworks (DB, HTTP, UI).
8. **Naming convention:** _package/module = noun_, _class = noun_, _function = verb + noun_.

### 3 Testing Policy

- **Goldilocks rule.** Exactly **one** happy‚Äëpath unit test per public function _unless_ complexity >‚ÄØ5.
- **Integration tests only at seams.** Use fakes/mocks internally.
- **Performance tests gated.** Only generate when the target class/function bears a `@PerfTest` decorator.

### 4 Agent Self‚ÄëReview Checklist (before emitting code)

1. Could this be **one function simpler**?
2. Did I introduce an abstraction used **only once**?
3. Did I write a performance test for a function or class without a `@PerfTest` decorator?
4. Can a junior dev grok each file in **<‚ÄØ5‚ÄØmin**?

### 5. Forbidden

- **NO any types** - Use specific, concrete types always
- **NO console.log in production code** - Use proper logging
- **NO keeping old and new code together** - Delete replaced code immediately
- **NO shared "kitchen-sink" modules** - One export per file!
- **NO hardcoded secrets or environment values**
- **NO direct DOM manipulation in React** - Use React patterns

## ü§î When You're Unsure

1. **Stop** and ask a clear, single question.
2. Offer options (A / B / C) if helpful.
3. Wait for user guidance before proceeding.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Check the documentation in `docs/`
- Use the context7 MCP tool for up-to-date library documentation
- Use web for research (the current year is 2025)
- If you need clarification, ask specific questions with options
