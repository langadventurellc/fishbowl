    pattern used by settings persistence. TypeScript compilation and all quality
    checks pass. External imports work correctly from consuming applications.

# Integrate Roles Persistence Exports in UI-Shared Package

## Context and Purpose

Update the main `packages/ui-shared/src/index.ts` file to export the new roles persistence types, making them available to consuming applications (desktop and future mobile). This follows the established pattern for settings persistence exports.

## Implementation Location

**File**: `packages/ui-shared/src/index.ts`

## Reference Pattern

Examine the existing settings persistence exports in the main index file and follow the same pattern for roles persistence.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Export Integration

Add roles persistence exports to the main index file:

```typescript
// Add to existing exports
export type { RolesPersistenceAdapter } from "./types/roles/persistence";
export { RolesPersistenceError } from "./types/roles/persistence";
```

### Export Organization

- [ ] **Consistent Grouping**: Place roles persistence exports near settings persistence exports
- [ ] **Type-Only Imports**: Use `export type` for interfaces
- [ ] **Class Exports**: Use regular `export` for error classes
- [ ] **Comment Organization**: Add appropriate section comments if needed

### Verification Steps

1. **Import Testing**: Verify exports can be imported from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
2. **Type Resolution**: Ensure TypeScript can resolve all exported types
3. **Build Testing**: Confirm package builds successfully with new exports

## Example Usage Verification

After implementation, these imports should work from consuming applications:

```typescript
// In desktop app
import {
  RolesPersistenceAdapter,
  RolesPersistenceError,
} from "@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared";
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Export Integration

- [ ] Roles persistence types added to main ui-shared index
- [ ] Export syntax follows established patterns
- [ ] Exports are grouped logically with related functionality

### Build Verification

- [ ] Package builds successfully with new exports
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [ ] No circular dependency issues introduced

### Import Testing

- [ ] New exports can be imported from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
- [ ] TypeScript properly resolves imported types
- [ ] Error class can be instantiated from external imports

## Technical Notes

- **Pattern Consistency**: Follow exact same export patterns as settings persistence
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript typing for all exports
- **Bundle Impact**: Monitor for any significant bundle size changes

## Dependencies

- Requires T-create-roles-persistence (barrel exports must exist)
- Final task in the feature - no other tasks depend on this

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Main ui-shared index.ts updated with roles persistence exports
- [ ] All new exports follow established naming and typing patterns
- [ ] Package builds successfully with TypeScript compilation
- [ ] External imports work correctly from consuming applications
- [ ] No build errors or type resolution issues introduced
