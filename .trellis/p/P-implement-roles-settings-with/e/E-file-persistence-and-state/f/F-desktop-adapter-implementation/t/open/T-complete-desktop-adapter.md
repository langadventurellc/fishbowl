# Complete Desktop Adapter Integration and Setup

## Context

Finalize the desktop adapter implementation by ensuring all components are properly integrated and the system works end-to-end.

## Implementation Requirements

### Main Process Integration

Verify `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts` includes:

- Import of setupRolesHandlers
- Call to setupRolesHandlers() in ready event handler
- Proper rolesRepositoryManager initialization with userData path

### App Integration

Update root App component or provider setup:

- Ensure RolesProvider is available where needed
- Verify proper provider hierarchy (if needed alongside SettingsProvider)
- Document integration pattern for future reference

### Export Validation

Verify all public exports are accessible:

- desktopRolesAdapter from adapters
- RolesProvider, useRolesAdapter from contexts
- All types properly exported and importable

### Documentation Updates

Create brief integration notes:

- How to use the roles adapter in components
- Relationship to existing settings persistence
- Error handling patterns for consumers

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Main process properly initializes roles handlers and repository
- [ ] RolesProvider is available for use in React components
- [ ] useRolesAdapter hook accessible throughout app
- [ ] All exports working correctly from their modules
- [ ] Integration follows same pattern as existing settings system
- [ ] End-to-end functionality verified through integration tests
- [ ] Error handling works properly across all layers
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Documentation covers usage patterns

## Dependencies

- T-create-main-process-ipc (needs handlers setup)
- T-create-rolesprovider-context (needs context provider)

## Testing Requirements

- Write integration test that exercises full adapter flow
- Test save -> load -> reset sequence through the adapter
- Test error propagation from repository through to adapter
- Verify proper initialization during app startup
- Test context provider integration in React component tree
- Ensure no memory leaks or improper cleanup
