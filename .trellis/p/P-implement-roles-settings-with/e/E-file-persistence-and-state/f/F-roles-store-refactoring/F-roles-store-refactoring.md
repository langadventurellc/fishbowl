# Roles Store Refactoring

## Purpose and Functionality

Refactor the existing Zustand roles store to integrate with the persistence adapter pattern, adding proper loading states and comprehensive error handling. The store will maintain the same public API while internally using the adapter for all persistence operations.

## Key Components to Implement

### Store Enhancements (`packages/ui-shared/src/stores/`)

- **Adapter Integration**: Add adapter property and initialization
- **Loading States**: Add proper async operation handling
- **Error Recovery**: Implement retry logic and error boundaries

### New Store Methods

- **initialize**: Load roles from persistence on startup
- **persistChanges**: Save current state to persistence
- **syncWithStorage**: Reload from storage (for external changes)
- **exportRoles/importRoles**: Bulk operations support

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Store State Management

- [ ] Maintain existing CRUD operations (createRole, updateRole, deleteRole)
- [ ] Add `isInitialized` flag for tracking initial load
- [ ] Add `isSaving` flag for save operations in progress
- [ ] Add `lastSyncTime` for tracking persistence state
- [ ] Preserve all existing methods and signatures
- [ ] Add adapter property with proper typing

### Loading and Initialization

- [ ] Load roles from persistence on store initialization
- [ ] Show loading state during initial fetch
- [ ] Fall back to empty array if no persisted data
- [ ] Handle corrupted data with partial recovery
- [ ] Log detailed errors for debugging
- [ ] Set initialized flag after first load

### Error Handling

- [ ] Catch and log adapter errors
- [ ] Provide user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Maintain operation queue during errors
- [ ] Never lose user data due to errors
- [ ] Emit error events for UI consumption

### Optimistic Updates

- [ ] Apply changes immediately to UI
- [ ] Track pending operations
- [ ] Rollback on persistence failure
- [ ] Maintain consistency during conflicts
- [ ] Handle concurrent modifications safely

## Technical Requirements

### Store Structure

```typescript
interface RolesStore extends RolesState, RolesActions {
  // Existing state
  roles: RoleViewModel[];
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;

  // New state
  adapter: RolesPersistenceAdapter | null;
  isInitialized: boolean;
  isSaving: boolean;
  lastSyncTime: string | null;
  pendingOperations: Operation[];

  // New methods
  initialize(adapter: RolesPersistenceAdapter): Promise<void>;
  persistChanges(): Promise<void>;
  syncWithStorage(): Promise<void>;
  setAdapter(adapter: RolesPersistenceAdapter): void;
}
```

### Implementation Patterns

- Use the same patterns as settings stores
- Use immer for immutable updates if available
- Follow existing error handling patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Dependencies

- Requires F-roles-persistence-adapter (interface)
- Requires F-data-mapping-layer (transformations)
- Uses existing Zustand store infrastructure
- Integrates with existing validation utilities

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all store methods
- Integration tests with mock adapter
- Error recovery scenario tests
- Concurrency tests for multiple operations
- Memory leak tests for subscribers

## Security Considerations

- Never expose adapter internals to UI
- Sanitize all inputs before persistence
- Validate data after loading from storage
- Implement rate limiting for save operations
- Clear sensitive data on store reset

## Performance Requirements

- Initial load completes in < 100ms
- Store operations remain synchronous for UI
- Memory usage stable with 100+ roles
- No UI blocking during persistence operations
