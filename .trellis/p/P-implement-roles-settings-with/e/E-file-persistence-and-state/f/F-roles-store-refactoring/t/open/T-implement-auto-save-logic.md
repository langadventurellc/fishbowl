# Implement Auto-save Logic with Debouncing

## Purpose

Add automatic persistence of role changes with debounced saving to batch rapid changes, including optimistic updates and rollback on failure.

## Implementation Details

### Auto-save Mechanism

- Trigger auto-save on any role modification (create, update, delete)
- Debounce saves by 500ms to batch rapid changes
- Show saving indicator during persistence operations
- Queue changes during active save operations

### Store Method Additions

Add these methods to `RolesActions`:

- `persistChanges(): Promise<void>` - Save current state to persistence
- `_debouncedSave: (roles: RoleViewModel[]) => void` - Internal debounced save function
- `_handleSaveError(error: any, rollbackData: RoleViewModel[]): void` - Error handling with rollback

### File Locations

- Update: `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/rolesStore.ts`

## Technical Requirements

### Debouncing Implementation

- Use a timeout-based debounce mechanism (500ms delay)
- Clear previous timeout when new changes occur
- Maintain reference to debounce timer in store closure

### Optimistic Updates

- Apply UI changes immediately for responsiveness
- Track original state before changes for potential rollback
- Rollback UI state if persistence fails

### Error Handling

- Catch adapter errors and log detailed information
- Show user-friendly error messages in store state
- Implement exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Never lose user data due to persistence failures

## Integration Points

### CRUD Method Updates

Modify existing methods to trigger auto-save:

- `createRole`: Apply change, then trigger debounced save
- `updateRole`: Apply change, then trigger debounced save
- `deleteRole`: Apply change, then trigger debounced save

### State Management

- Set `isSaving: true` during save operations
- Update `lastSyncTime` on successful saves
- Add pending operations to queue during saves
- Clear error state on successful operations

## Dependencies

- Requires adapter integration task completion
- Import `mapRolesUIToPersistence` mapping function
- Use existing error handling utilities

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Auto-save triggers on any role modification
- [ ] Debouncing batches rapid changes (500ms delay)
- [ ] `isSaving` flag indicates save in progress
- [ ] Failed saves rollback optimistic updates
- [ ] `lastSyncTime` updates on successful saves
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Concurrent operations handled safely
- [ ] No data loss during error conditions

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for debounced save behavior
- Tests for optimistic updates and rollback
- Error handling tests with mock adapter failures
- Concurrent operation tests
- Performance tests for rapid changes

## Implementation Notes

- Use `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` for debouncing
- Store original state snapshots for rollback
- Log all persistence operations for debugging
- Follow existing store error handling patterns
- Ensure UI remains responsive during saves
