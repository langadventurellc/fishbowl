    setAdapter and initialize methods. Implemented both methods in store with
    proper error handling, state management, and data transformation using

    Successfully integrated RolesPersistenceAdapter interface into the existing
    Zustand roles store, adding foundation for file-based persistence while
    maintaining backward compatibility.


    **Key Implementation Details:**


    - **Added new state properties** to RolesState interface:
      - `adapter: RolesPersistenceAdapter | null` - Stores persistence adapter instance
      - `isInitialized: boolean` - Tracks whether initial data has been loaded
      - `isSaving: boolean` - Indicates save operations in progress  
      - `lastSyncTime: string | null` - ISO timestamp of last successful sync
      - `pendingOperations: Array<{ type: string; timestamp: string }>` - Queue for pending operations

    - **Added new methods** to RolesActions interface:
      - `setAdapter(adapter: RolesPersistenceAdapter): void` - Simple setter for adapter instance
      - `initialize(adapter: RolesPersistenceAdapter): Promise<void>` - Loads initial data from persistence

    - **Implemented initialization logic** that:
      - Sets the adapter and loading state
      - Loads data using adapter's `load()` method
      - Uses `mapRolesPersistenceToUI` mapping function to transform persistence data to UI format
      - Sets `isInitialized = true` after successful load
      - Handles load errors gracefully without crashing UI
      - Logs detailed errors for debugging

    - **Maintains backward compatibility** - existing store consumers continue
    to work unchanged

    - **Follows established patterns** - used same error handling and async
    patterns as existing settings stores

    - **Proper TypeScript integration** - all new properties and methods fully
    typed


    **Error Handling:**

    - Graceful error handling during initialization

    - Detailed error logging for debugging

    - Never throws errors that could crash the UI

    - Clear error states with descriptive messages


    All quality checks pass (lint, format, type-check) and the implementation is
    ready for integration with the broader roles persistence system.

# Add Adapter Integration to Roles Store

## Purpose

Integrate the `RolesPersistenceAdapter` interface into the existing Zustand roles store, adding the foundation for file-based persistence while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Implementation Details

### Store State Additions

Add these new state properties to `RolesState` interface:

- `adapter: RolesPersistenceAdapter | null` - The persistence adapter instance
- `isInitialized: boolean` - Whether initial data has been loaded
- `isSaving: boolean` - Whether a save operation is in progress
- `lastSyncTime: string | null` - ISO timestamp of last successful sync
- `pendingOperations: Array<{ type: string; timestamp: string }>` - Queue of pending operations

### Store Actions Additions

Add these new methods to `RolesActions` interface:

- `setAdapter(adapter: RolesPersistenceAdapter): void` - Set the adapter instance
- `initialize(adapter: RolesPersistenceAdapter): Promise<void>` - Load initial data from persistence

### File Locations

- Update: `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/rolesStore.ts`

## Technical Requirements

### State Management

- Add new state properties with proper TypeScript typing
- Initialize new properties with appropriate defaults
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing store consumers

### Method Implementation

- `setAdapter`: Simple setter that stores the adapter instance
- `initialize`:
  - Sets the adapter
  - Loads data using the adapter's `load()` method
  - Uses mapping functions to transform persistence data to UI format
  - Sets `isInitialized = true` after successful load
  - Handles load errors gracefully

## Dependencies

- Import `RolesPersistenceAdapter` from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
- Import mapping functions: `mapRolesPersistenceToUI`
- Use existing error handling patterns from the store

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New state properties added with proper typing
- [ ] `setAdapter` method stores adapter reference
- [ ] `initialize` method loads initial data from adapter
- [ ] Store maintains backward compatibility
- [ ] Error handling matches existing store patterns
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] Unit tests pass for new functionality

## Testing Requirements

- Add unit tests for `setAdapter` method
- Add unit tests for `initialize` method with mock adapter
- Test error handling during initialization
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass

## Implementation Notes

- Follow the exact patterns used in existing settings stores
- Use proper async/await error handling
- Log detailed errors for debugging
- Never throw errors that could crash the UI
