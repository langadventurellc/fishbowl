# Desktop Integration and Services Epic

## Purpose and Goals

Implement the desktop-specific infrastructure for roles file persistence, including file operations, IPC communication, and integration with the existing Electron settings architecture. This epic provides the platform-specific adapter that connects the shared business logic to the desktop file system.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### File Operations (`apps/desktop`)

- **FileStorageService Integration**: Extend existing service for roles.json operations
- **File Path Management**: Handle `app.getPath("userData")/roles.json` correctly
- **Atomic File Operations**: Ensure safe read/write operations with proper error handling
- **File Permissions**: Handle file system permission errors gracefully

### Settings Architecture Integration

- **Adapter Implementation**: Concrete desktop adapter following the persistence interface
- **Error Handling**: Desktop-specific error handling for file operations
- **Initialization Logic**: Create initial roles.json file with example data
- **File Validation**: Validate existing files on load and handle corruption

### IPC Communication (if needed)

- **Settings Integration**: Integrate with existing settings IPC channels if appropriate
- **Error Propagation**: Ensure file operation errors surface to UI properly
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking file operations with proper progress indication

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### File Operations Requirements

- [ ] **Roles File Creation**: `roles.json` created in correct user data directory on first run
- [ ] **Safe Read Operations**: File reading handles missing files, permission errors, corrupted JSON
- [ ] **Safe Write Operations**: File writing is atomic to prevent data corruption during crashes
- [ ] **Initial Data**: New installations get `roles.json` with example roles for demonstration
- [ ] **File Validation**: Existing files validate against schema, with graceful error handling for invalid data
- [ ] **Backup on Corruption**: Invalid files backed up before attempting recovery

### Integration Requirements

- [ ] **FileStorageService Integration**: Uses existing service patterns for consistency
- [ ] **Settings Architecture**: Follows same patterns as general/appearance/advanced settings
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Desktop-specific errors properly handled and reported
- [ ] **Async Pattern**: File operations don't block UI with proper loading states
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of file handles and resources

### Data Integrity Requirements

- [ ] **Atomic Writes**: File writes complete fully or not at all (no partial writes)
- [ ] **Concurrent Access**: Handle multiple app instances accessing same file safely
- [ ] **Permission Errors**: Clear error messages for file permission issues
- [ ] **Disk Space**: Handle insufficient disk space errors gracefully
- [ ] **File Locks**: Proper handling of file locking on different operating systems

## Technical Considerations

### File System Considerations

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Windows, macOS, Linux file system differences
- **User data directory**: Use Electron's `app.getPath("userData")` correctly
- **File encoding**: Consistent UTF-8 encoding for cross-platform compatibility
- **Line endings**: Handle different line endings across platforms

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure

- Follow exact patterns from existing settings file operations
- Use same error handling strategies as other settings
- Maintain consistency with existing FileStorageService usage
- Leverage existing IPC patterns where appropriate

### Security Considerations

- File permissions appropriate for user data
- No sensitive data exposure in error messages
- Safe handling of malformed JSON to prevent code execution
- Proper sanitization of file paths

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: E-file-persistence-and-state (adapter interface must exist)
- **Dependents**: E-settings-ui-components-and-integration (UI needs working persistence)

## Estimated Scale

- **Files to Create**: 2-3 new desktop service files
- **Files to Modify**: 1-2 existing service files (extend existing FileStorageService patterns)
- **Estimated Features**: 3-4 features

## User Stories

- **As a user**, I want my roles to be stored safely on my computer so they persist between app sessions
- **As a user**, I want clear error messages if something goes wrong with file operations so I can resolve issues
- **As a user**, I want my roles file to be human-readable so I can edit it directly if needed
- **As a system administrator**, I want proper file permissions so roles data is secure
- **As a developer**, I want consistent error handling so I can provide good user experience

## Non-functional Requirements

### Performance

- File read operations must complete within 100ms for typical role files
- File write operations must be non-blocking and provide progress feedback
- App startup must not be delayed by roles file loading
- File operations must not impact overall application responsiveness

### Reliability

- File writes must be atomic to prevent corruption during system crashes
- Must handle concurrent access from multiple app instances gracefully
- Corrupted files must be recoverable with proper backup strategies
- Error conditions must not cause application crashes

### Security

- Roles file must have appropriate user-only permissions
- No sensitive information exposed in error logs or messages
- Safe parsing of JSON files to prevent code execution attacks
- Proper validation of file paths to prevent directory traversal

### Compatibility

- Must work consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Handle different file systems (NTFS, APFS, ext4, etc.)
- Support various user data directory configurations
- Graceful handling of different user permission configurations

## Integration Points

### With Shared Business Logic Epic

- Implements persistence adapter interface
- Handles all file operation requirements from business logic
- Provides concrete error handling for abstract error types

### With UI Components Epic

- Ensures file operations complete properly for UI feedback
- Provides error information for UI error displays
- Supports UI loading states during file operations

### With Existing Desktop Infrastructure

- Extends existing FileStorageService patterns
- Integrates with existing settings error handling
- Uses existing IPC communication patterns where appropriate

## Success Metrics

- Roles file created successfully on first application run
- All file operations complete within performance requirements
- Error conditions handled gracefully without application crashes
- File data integrity maintained across all scenarios (crashes, concurrent access, etc.)
- File operations follow existing desktop settings patterns consistently
- User data properly secured with appropriate file permissions
