# Integrate Roles Initialization with App Startup

## Context and Purpose

Integrate the initial roles file creation logic into the existing application startup sequence. This task ensures that new installations automatically get example roles without blocking application startup or causing crashes on failure.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Research Existing Integration Points

First, analyze the existing codebase to understand:

- Where `rolesRepositoryManager.initialize()` is called during startup
- How other initialization tasks are handled (e.g., settings initialization)
- What error handling patterns are used for startup tasks
- Where to add logging for initialization events

### Integration Location

Based on the existing desktop architecture, likely integration points:

- `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts` - Main process initialization
- Near where `setupRolesHandlers()` is called (line ~239)
- After `rolesRepositoryManager.initialize()` but before IPC handlers setup

### Implementation Approach

Add the initialization call in the appropriate startup sequence:

```typescript
import { createInitialRolesFile } from "../data/initialization/createInitialRolesFile";

// In the main application startup function
async function initializeApplication() {
  try {
    // ... existing initialization code ...

    // Initialize roles repository
    rolesRepositoryManager.initialize(userDataPath);

    // Create initial roles if needed (NEW)
    const repository = rolesRepositoryManager.get();
    const initResult = await createInitialRolesFile(repository);

    if (initResult.created) {
      logger.info("Created initial roles for new installation");
    } else if (initResult.error) {
      logger.warn("Failed to create initial roles", {
        error: initResult.error,
      });
      // Continue startup - not a critical failure
    }

    // Setup IPC handlers after initialization
    setupRolesHandlers();

    // ... rest of startup sequence ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Existing error handling
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Non-Blocking**: Initialization failures should not prevent app startup
- **Logging**: All outcomes (success, skip, failure) should be logged
- **Graceful Degradation**: App continues with empty roles if initialization fails
- **User Notification**: Consider subtle notification for initialization failures

### Startup Sequence Integration

Ensure proper ordering:

1. Repository manager initialization (existing)
2. Initial roles creation (NEW)
3. IPC handlers setup (existing)
4. UI startup (existing)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Proper Integration Point Identified**:
  - Located the correct place in application startup sequence
  - Identified where `rolesRepositoryManager` is initialized
  - Confirmed integration follows existing patterns
  - Verified startup order is correct

- [ ] **Initialization Call Added**:
  - `createInitialRolesFile()` called during app startup
  - Called after repository initialization
  - Called before IPC handlers setup
  - Proper error handling implemented

- [ ] **Non-Blocking Behavior**:
  - Application starts successfully even if roles initialization fails
  - No startup crashes from initialization errors
  - User can still use app with empty roles if needed
  - Initialization happens asynchronously where appropriate

- [ ] **Logging Integration**:
  - Success cases logged at appropriate level (info)
  - Failure cases logged with error details (warn/error)
  - Follows existing logging patterns and format
  - Includes relevant context (file paths, error details)

- [ ] **Unit Tests for Integration**:
  - Test successful initialization during startup
  - Test startup continues when initialization fails
  - Test logging outputs for different scenarios
  - Mock dependencies appropriately for testing

## Testing Requirements

### Integration Tests (`__tests__/appStartupIntegration.test.ts`)

1. **Successful Startup Integration**:

   ```typescript
   describe("App Startup with Roles Initialization", () => {
     test("initializes roles during normal startup", async () => {
       // Mock successful repository initialization
       // Mock successful roles initialization
       // Call startup sequence
       // Verify createInitialRolesFile was called
       // Verify startup completed successfully
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Error Handling During Startup**:

   ```typescript
   test("continues startup when roles initialization fails", async () => {
     // Mock repository initialization success
     // Mock roles initialization failure
     // Call startup sequence
     // Verify startup still completes
     // Verify error was logged appropriately
   });
   ```

3. **Startup Sequence Validation**:
   ```typescript
   test("maintains correct initialization order", async () => {
     // Mock all dependencies
     // Track call order
     // Verify: repository init → roles init → IPC setup
   });
   ```

### Mock Strategy

- Mock `rolesRepositoryManager` and its methods
- Mock `createInitialRolesFile` function
- Mock logger to verify log calls
- Use dependency injection where possible

## Security Considerations

- Ensure initialization doesn't expose sensitive file paths
- Validate that error messages don't leak system information
- Confirm startup behavior is consistent across different permission levels
- Log security-relevant initialization events

## Performance Requirements

- Add minimal overhead to application startup (<20ms)
- Don't block UI appearance or user interaction
- Initialize in parallel with other non-critical startup tasks where possible
- Fail fast on initialization errors

## Dependencies

- Requires `T-implement-initial-roles-file` (the initialization function)
- Uses existing `rolesRepositoryManager`
- Integrates with existing application startup sequence
- Uses existing logger configuration

## Integration Research Steps

1. **Analyze Current Startup Flow**:

   ```bash
   # Search for repository initialization
   grep -r "rolesRepositoryManager" apps/desktop/src/
   # Find main startup function
   grep -r "setupRolesHandlers" apps/desktop/src/
   # Look for similar initialization patterns
   grep -r "initialize" apps/desktop/src/electron/
   ```

2. **Study Error Handling Patterns**:
   - How are startup errors currently handled?
   - What logging patterns are used?
   - How are non-critical failures managed?

## File Structure Modified

```
apps/desktop/src/electron/
├── main.ts                           # Modified - add initialization call
└── __tests__/
    └── appStartupIntegration.test.ts # New - integration tests
```

## Success Metrics

- Application startup time increases by <20ms
- 100% of new installations get example roles
- Zero startup crashes from initialization failures
- Clear audit trail of initialization attempts in logs
- Integration follows established application patterns
- All edge cases properly tested and handled
