# Validate Implementation and Quality Checks

## Context

Final validation of the complete default roles implementation. Ensure all code passes quality checks, builds successfully, and the feature works end-to-end as expected.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Build Validation

**Commands to run:**

```bash
# From project root
pnpm build:libs
pnpm build:desktop
```

**Verification**:

- [ ] Shared package builds without errors
- [ ] Desktop app builds without errors
- [ ] JSON file is included in shared package dist
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with JSON imports
- [ ] No missing dependencies or import errors

### 2. Quality Checks

**Commands to run:**

```bash
# From project root
pnpm quality
```

**This includes:**

- [ ] Linting passes (ESLint)
- [ ] Type checking passes (TypeScript)
- [ ] Code formatting is correct (Prettier)
- [ ] No quality violations introduced

### 3. Test Execution

**Commands to run:**

```bash
# From project root
pnpm test
```

**Verification**:

- [ ] All new tests pass
- [ ] Existing tests remain passing (no regressions)
- [ ] Test coverage meets requirements
- [ ] No flaky or intermittent test failures

### 4. Manual Testing

**First-Run Scenario**:

1. Delete or rename existing `userData/roles.json` file
2. Start the desktop application
3. Navigate to roles/settings UI
4. Verify default roles are present and populated

**Expected Results**:

- [ ] 4 default roles appear immediately
- [ ] Roles have proper names, descriptions, and system prompts
- [ ] No empty or placeholder content
- [ ] Roles can be edited and saved
- [ ] roles.json file is created in userData directory

### 5. Integration Verification

**Test Scenarios**:

- [ ] Fresh installation shows default roles
- [ ] Existing installations with roles.json are unaffected
- [ ] Default roles persist after app restart
- [ ] Users can modify default roles successfully
- [ ] Edited roles maintain their modifications

## Documentation Updates

### Code Documentation

- [ ] Verify JSDoc comments are present and accurate
- [ ] Update any existing comments about empty roles behavior
- [ ] Ensure function documentation explains JSON-based approach

### README Updates (if needed)

- [ ] Check if roles feature is documented in README
- [ ] Update documentation to mention default roles provision
- [ ] Verify build instructions account for JSON files

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Validation

- [ ] All builds complete successfully
- [ ] Quality checks pass without violations
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] JSON imports work correctly

### Functional Validation

- [ ] Default roles appear on first app launch
- [ ] Default roles have high-quality, professional content
- [ ] File persistence works correctly
- [ ] User can modify and save roles
- [ ] No impact on existing user data

### Performance Validation

- [ ] App startup time not significantly affected
- [ ] Default roles creation completes quickly
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable
- [ ] No performance regressions detected

## Error Scenarios Testing

**Test these edge cases:**

- [ ] JSON file corrupted or invalid (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Write permissions denied (should still provide defaults)
- [ ] Disk space exhausted (should handle gracefully)
- [ ] Network issues during file operations (not applicable but verify robustness)

## Rollback Verification

**Ensure clean rollback is possible:**

- [ ] Document what files were changed
- [ ] Verify rollback doesn't break existing functionality
- [ ] Test that reverting changes restores original behavior

## Success Criteria Summary

The implementation is ready when:

1. All quality checks pass
2. Manual testing confirms default roles work
3. No regressions in existing functionality
4. Performance remains acceptable
5. Error scenarios are handled gracefully

## Final Checklist

- [ ] Run `pnpm build:libs` - success
- [ ] Run `pnpm quality` - all checks pass
- [ ] Run `pnpm test` - all tests pass
- [ ] Manual first-run test - default roles appear
- [ ] Manual persistence test - roles survive restart
- [ ] Check logs for appropriate debug messages
- [ ] Verify no placeholder or low-quality content
- [ ] Confirm backwards compatibility

## Dependencies

- Depends on: T-add-comprehensive-tests-for (all tests must be written first)
- Final task in the feature implementation
- Validates all previous work is integrated correctly
