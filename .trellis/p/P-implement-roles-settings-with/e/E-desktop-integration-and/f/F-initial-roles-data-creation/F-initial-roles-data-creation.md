# Initial Roles Data Creation

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement automatic creation of example roles data for new installations, providing users with demonstration roles that showcase the feature's capabilities. This feature ensures new users have immediate examples to understand how roles work without having to create them from scratch.

## Key Components to Implement

### Example Roles Definition (`apps/desktop/src/data/`)

- **defaultRoles.ts**: Define a set of example roles with diverse use cases
- **Role Examples**: Include 3-5 demonstration roles (e.g., Project Manager, Technical Writer, Code Reviewer, Creative Director, Data Analyst)
- **Quality Examples**: Each role should have a meaningful name, clear description, and well-crafted system prompt

### Initialization Logic

- **First-Run Detection**: Check if roles.json exists on application startup
- **Example Data Creation**: Create roles.json with example roles if not found
- **Version Tracking**: Include metadata to identify initial vs user-modified data
- **Migration Path**: Support for updating example roles in future versions

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Example Roles Requirements

- [ ] **Diverse Examples**: Include 3-5 roles demonstrating different use cases
  - Project management role with focus on planning and coordination
  - Technical role for code review or architecture discussions
  - Creative role for brainstorming and ideation
  - Analytical role for data analysis and insights
  - Writing role for documentation and content creation

- [ ] **High-Quality Content**: Each example role includes:
  - Clear, descriptive name (max 100 chars)
  - Informative description explaining the role's purpose (max 500 chars)
  - Well-crafted system prompt that effectively guides AI behavior (1000-2000 chars)
  - Proper timestamps for creation and last update

- [ ] **Professional Examples**: System prompts should:
  - Demonstrate best practices for prompt engineering
  - Show different prompting techniques and styles
  - Include clear instructions and context setting
  - Avoid placeholder or low-quality content

### Initialization Behavior

- [ ] **First-Run Creation**: On application startup, if roles.json doesn't exist:
  - Create the file with example roles
  - Log the creation for debugging
  - Set appropriate file permissions
  - Validate the created file immediately

- [ ] **Existing File Preservation**: Never overwrite existing roles.json
  - Check for file existence before any write operations
  - Respect user modifications and customizations
  - No forced updates to existing role data

- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of initialization failures
  - Log errors if example creation fails
  - Continue with empty roles if necessary
  - Don't block application startup
  - Provide clear error messages for debugging

### Data Structure

- [ ] **Metadata Inclusion**: Include metadata in initial file:
  - `isInitialData: true` flag to identify example data
  - `initialDataVersion: "1.0.0"` for future migrations
  - `createdBy: "system"` to distinguish from user-created content

- [ ] **Standards Compliance**: Example data must:
  - Validate against existing Zod schemas
  - Follow the exact PersistedRolesSettingsData structure
  - Include all required fields with proper types
  - Use current schema version

## Implementation Guidance

### File Structure

```
apps/desktop/src/data/
├── initialization/
│   ├── defaultRoles.ts          # Example roles definition
│   ├── createInitialRolesFile.ts # Creation logic
│   └── index.ts                 # Barrel exports
```

### Technical Approach

- Define example roles as a constant array
- Use existing RolesRepository for file creation
- Integrate with application initialization flow
- Follow existing patterns from settings initialization
- Use TypeScript for type safety throughout

### Integration Points

- Call initialization during app startup (after repository initialization)
- Use existing FileStorageService for file operations
- Validate using existing schema validation utilities
- Log using existing logger configuration

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for example roles data structure
- Integration tests for first-run creation
- Tests for existing file preservation
- Error scenario tests (permissions, disk space)
- Validation tests for example data against schemas

## Security Considerations

- Ensure example roles don't contain sensitive information
- Set appropriate file permissions on creation
- Validate all data before writing to disk
- Don't expose file paths in error messages
- Sanitize any dynamic content in examples

## Performance Requirements

- Initial creation completes within 100ms
- No blocking of application startup
- Efficient file write operations
- Minimal memory usage for example data
- Quick validation of created file

## Dependencies

- Uses existing RolesRepository for file operations
- Requires FileStorageService for atomic writes
- Depends on schema validation from shared package
- Integrates with existing logger infrastructure

## Success Metrics

- New installations have working example roles immediately
- Example roles demonstrate diverse use cases effectively
- File creation doesn't impact startup performance
- No data loss or corruption of existing user data
- Clear, professional examples that help users understand the feature
- Proper error handling for all edge cases
