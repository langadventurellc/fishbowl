# Enhanced Error Handling

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement comprehensive error handling for all file system operations with clear, actionable user messages and recovery strategies. This feature ensures users understand what went wrong and provides specific steps to resolve issues, improving the overall reliability and user experience of roles management.

## Key Components to Implement

### Error Classification System (`apps/desktop/src/data/errors/`)

- **RolesErrorTypes**: Enumeration of all possible error scenarios
- **ErrorContext**: Rich context information for debugging
- **UserMessages**: User-friendly error messages with solutions
- **RecoveryStrategies**: Automated recovery attempts for common errors

### Error Recovery Framework

- **RetryLogic**: Intelligent retry with exponential backoff
- **FallbackStrategies**: Alternative approaches when primary fails
- **ErrorReporting**: Detailed error reporting for support
- **UserGuidance**: Step-by-step resolution instructions

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Error Classification

- [ ] **File System Errors**:
  - Permission denied (read/write/delete)
  - File not found (differentiate from first run)
  - Disk full or quota exceeded
  - Path too long for operating system
  - Invalid characters in file path
  - Network drive unavailable

- [ ] **Data Integrity Errors**:
  - JSON parse errors with line/column info
  - Schema validation failures with field details
  - Corrupted file detection with recovery options
  - Encoding issues (non-UTF8 content)
  - Truncated file detection
  - Version mismatch errors

- [ ] **Concurrency Errors**:
  - Lock acquisition timeout
  - File modified during operation
  - Stale data detection
  - Process communication failures
  - Race condition detection
  - Deadlock scenarios

- [ ] **System Resource Errors**:
  - Out of memory during operation
  - Too many open files
  - Process limits exceeded
  - System call failures
  - Antivirus interference
  - OS-specific limitations

### User-Friendly Messages

- [ ] **Message Components**:
  - What happened (clear, non-technical summary)
  - Why it happened (likely cause)
  - What to do (actionable steps)
  - Support information (error code, timestamp)
  - Recovery options (retry, restore, reset)

- [ ] **Message Examples**:

  ```
  Permission Denied:
  "Cannot save roles - permission denied"
  "The application doesn't have permission to write to the roles file."
  "Try: 1) Run as administrator, 2) Check file permissions, 3) Move to different location"
  Error Code: ROLES_ERR_PERMISSION_WRITE
  ```

- [ ] **Localization Ready**:
  - Message keys for translation
  - Parameterized messages
  - Cultural formatting considerations
  - RTL language support

### Recovery Strategies

- [ ] **Automatic Recovery**:
  - Retry with backoff for transient errors
  - Switch to backup file on corruption
  - Create new file if missing
  - Clear locks from dead processes
  - Fallback to memory-only mode

- [ ] **Guided Recovery**:
  - Step-by-step permission fix guide
  - Disk space cleanup suggestions
  - Network drive reconnection steps
  - Antivirus exclusion instructions
  - File recovery wizard

- [ ] **Diagnostic Tools**:
  - Generate diagnostic report
  - Test file permissions
  - Verify disk space
  - Check process limits
  - Network connectivity test

### Error Reporting

- [ ] **Error Context Capture**:
  - Full stack trace
  - System information (OS, version)
  - File paths (sanitized)
  - Operation being performed
  - Timestamp and duration
  - Previous successful operations

- [ ] **Privacy Protection**:
  - Remove sensitive paths
  - Anonymize user data
  - Exclude role content
  - Hash identifiers
  - Opt-in telemetry

- [ ] **Support Integration**:
  - Export error report
  - Copy to clipboard
  - Email support directly
  - GitHub issue template
  - Community forum format

### UI Integration

- [ ] **Error Display**:
  - Non-blocking toast notifications
  - Detailed error dialog option
  - Inline validation errors
  - Status bar indicators
  - Error history view

- [ ] **Progressive Disclosure**:
  - Simple message initially
  - "Show details" for technical info
  - "Get help" for solutions
  - "Report issue" for support
  - Remember user preference

### File Structure

├── RolesErrorTypes.ts          # Error classification
├── ErrorMessages.ts            # User-friendly messages
├── RecoveryManager.ts          # Recovery strategies

```

### Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
class EnhancedRolesError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public readonly type: RolesErrorType,
    public readonly context: ErrorContext,
    public readonly recovery?: RecoveryStrategy[],
    cause?: Error,
  ) {
    super(getUserMessage(type, context));
    this.cause = cause;
  }

  async attemptRecovery(): Promise<boolean> {
    for (const strategy of this.recovery || []) {
      if (await strategy.attempt()) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  }

  toUserNotification(): UserNotification {
    return {
      title: this.getUserTitle(),
      message: this.message,
      actions: this.getRecoveryActions(),
      severity: this.getSeverity(),
    };
  }
}
```

### Integration Points

- Enhance existing error handling in RolesRepository
- Add error boundaries in React components
- Integrate with notification system
- Connect to logging infrastructure
- Support debug mode for developers

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for each error type
- Integration tests for recovery strategies
- User message validation tests
- Localization tests
- Error reporting privacy tests
- UI integration tests
- Stress tests for error conditions

## Security Considerations

- Never expose full file paths
- Sanitize error messages
- Validate recovery operations
- Prevent information leakage
- Secure error report transmission
- Rate limit error reporting

## Performance Requirements

- Error detection < 10ms
- Message generation < 5ms
- Recovery attempt < 1 second
- Non-blocking error display
- Efficient error logging
- Minimal memory for error history

## Dependencies

- Requires all previous features completed
- Uses existing notification system
- Integrates with logger
- Uses i18n for localization
- Leverages existing UI components

## Success Metrics

- User-reported errors reduced by 50%
- Successful error recovery rate > 80%
- Average resolution time decreased
- Support ticket reduction
- User satisfaction with error handling improved
- Clear error messages in 100% of scenarios
