# Comprehensive Testing and Validation of Role Creation Form

## Context

After implementing all the missing features and fixes, the role creation form needs comprehensive testing to ensure all functionality works correctly together. This includes field validation, form submission, error handling, accessibility, and user experience testing. No integration or performance tests are to be written.

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing

#### 1. Form Field Validation

**Name Field Testing:**

- [ ] Required field validation (empty input shows error)
- [ ] Minimum length validation (less than 2 chars shows error)
- [ ] Maximum length validation (over 50 chars prevents input)
- [ ] Character restrictions (special chars show validation error)
- [ ] Uniqueness validation (duplicate name shows error)
- [ ] Whitespace-only input validation (shows error)
- [ ] Character counter updates correctly (0/50 format)
- [ ] Character counter color changes at thresholds (80%, 90%)

**Description Field Testing:**

- [ ] Required field validation (empty input shows error)
- [ ] Maximum length validation (over 200 chars prevents input)
- [ ] Whitespace-only input validation (shows error)
- [ ] Character counter updates correctly (0/200 format)
- [ ] Character counter color changes at thresholds
- [ ] Textarea allows line breaks and formatting

**System Prompt Field Testing:**

- [ ] Required field validation (empty input shows error)
- [ ] Maximum length validation (over 5000 chars prevents input)
- [ ] Whitespace-only input validation (shows error)
- [ ] Character counter updates correctly (0/5000 format)
- [ ] Character counter color changes at thresholds (80%, 90%)
- [ ] Textarea allows line breaks and multi-line content
- [ ] Textarea resizing works properly

#### 2. Form Submission Testing

- [ ] Valid form data submits successfully
- [ ] Invalid form prevents submission (submit button disabled)
- [ ] Loading state shows during submission
- [ ] Form resets after successful submission
- [ ] Unsaved changes tracking works correctly
- [ ] Error handling displays store errors properly

#### 3. Modal Interaction Testing

- [ ] Modal opens centered with backdrop
- [ ] Modal closes on backdrop click (with unsaved changes confirmation)
- [ ] Modal closes on Escape key (with unsaved changes confirmation)
- [ ] Unsaved changes confirmation dialog works
- [ ] Modal prevents body scrolling when open

### Accessibility Testing

#### 4. Keyboard Navigation

- [ ] Tab order: name → description → system prompt → cancel → save
- [ ] Shift+Tab reverses navigation correctly
- [ ] Focus trapped within modal (doesn't escape)
- [ ] Initial focus on name field when modal opens
- [ ] Focus returns to trigger element when modal closes
- [ ] Enter key behavior appropriate for each field type
- [ ] Escape key closes modal with confirmation if needed

#### 5. Screen Reader Testing

- [ ] Field labels announced correctly
- [ ] Required field indicators announced
- [ ] Character counters announced on change
- [ ] Validation errors announced immediately
- [ ] Form submission results announced
- [ ] Modal open/close announced appropriately

#### 6. Visual Accessibility

- [ ] Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast for text and counters
- [ ] Error states clearly distinguishable
- [ ] Character counter colors provide sufficient contrast
- [ ] Loading states visible and clear

### User Experience Testing

#### 7. Edit Mode Testing

- [ ] Form pre-populates with existing role data
- [ ] Name uniqueness excludes current role
- [ ] All fields editable in edit mode
- [ ] Save button shows "Update Role" text
- [ ] Changes persist correctly to store

#### 8. Error Handling Testing

- [ ] Network errors display user-friendly messages
- [ ] Validation errors clear when fields become valid
- [ ] Multiple validation errors show simultaneously
- [ ] Error focus management works (focus moves to first error)
- [ ] Form remains usable after errors

#### 9. Performance Testing

- [ ] Form renders quickly (under 100ms)
- [ ] Character counters update smoothly while typing
- [ ] Validation debouncing works (no excessive API calls)
- [ ] Large text areas perform well with long content
- [ ] Modal animations are smooth and responsive

### Integration Testing

#### 10. Store Integration

- [ ] createRole called with correct data structure
- [ ] updateRole called with correct data in edit mode
- [ ] Store errors handled and displayed properly
- [ ] Optimistic updates work correctly
- [ ] Role list updates after successful creation/edit

#### 11. Cross-Browser Testing

- [ ] Form works correctly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Focus management consistent across browsers
- [ ] Character counting works in all browsers
- [ ] Modal behavior consistent across platforms

## Technical Validation

#### 12. Code Quality

- [ ] TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] ESLint passes without warnings
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Proper error boundaries handle unexpected errors
- [ ] Memory leaks avoided (event listeners cleaned up)

#### 13. Type Safety

- [ ] Form data types match schema expectations
- [ ] Component props properly typed
- [ ] No type assertion workarounds needed
- [ ] Validation types consistent with schema

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All field validations work correctly with appropriate error messages
- [ ] Form submission succeeds with valid data and includes all three fields
- [ ] Tab navigation follows expected order and focus management works
- [ ] Character counters function correctly with color feedback
- [ ] Edit mode properly pre-populates and updates existing roles
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- [ ] Form integrates seamlessly with existing roles store
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors or runtime exceptions
- [ ] Performance requirements met (responsive interactions)

## Testing Tools and Methods

- **Manual Testing**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader testing
- **Browser Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility verification
- **Accessibility Tools**: axe-core, WAVE, screen reader testing
- **Performance Tools**: Browser DevTools performance monitoring
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript strict mode compilation

## Implementation Approach

1. **Systematic Testing**: Work through each category methodically
2. **Bug Documentation**: Record any issues found with reproduction steps
3. **Fix Priority**: Address critical issues immediately, minor issues as needed
4. **Regression Testing**: Re-test after fixes to ensure no new issues
5. **User Acceptance**: Final validation that all requirements are met

## Dependencies

- Requires all previous implementation tasks to be completed
- Need access to development environment for testing
- May require bug fixes based on testing results
