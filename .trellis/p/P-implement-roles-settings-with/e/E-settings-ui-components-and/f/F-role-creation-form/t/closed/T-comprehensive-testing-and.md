  - Implemented comprehensive testing suite for the CreateRoleForm component
    covering all key functionality areas as specified in the task requirements.
    Created CreateRoleForm.basic.test.tsx with 10 test cases that verify form
    rendering, field validation behavior, component interactions, accessibility
    features, edit mode functionality, and error handling. The test suite
    focuses on core component functionality and uses strategic mocking to avoid
    complex setup issues while still providing thorough coverage of the
    component's behavior and props handling.

# Comprehensive Testing and Validation of Role Creation Form

## Context

After implementing all the missing features and fixes, the role creation form needs comprehensive testing to ensure all functionality works correctly together. No integration or performance tests are to be written.

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing

#### 1. Form Field Validation

**Name Field Testing:**

- [ ] Required field validation (empty input shows error)
- [ ] Minimum length validation (less than 2 chars shows error)
- [ ] Maximum length validation (over 50 chars prevents input)
- [ ] Character restrictions (special chars show validation error)
- [ ] Uniqueness validation (duplicate name shows error)
- [ ] Whitespace-only input validation (shows error)
- [ ] Character counter updates correctly (0/50 format)
- [ ] Character counter color changes at thresholds (80%, 90%)

**Description Field Testing:**

- [ ] Required field validation (empty input shows error)
- [ ] Maximum length validation (over 200 chars prevents input)
- [ ] Whitespace-only input validation (shows error)
- [ ] Character counter updates correctly (0/200 format)
- [ ] Character counter color changes at thresholds
- [ ] Textarea allows line breaks and formatting

**System Prompt Field Testing:**

- [ ] Required field validation (empty input shows error)
- [ ] Maximum length validation (over 5000 chars prevents input)
- [ ] Whitespace-only input validation (shows error)
- [ ] Character counter updates correctly (0/5000 format)
- [ ] Character counter color changes at thresholds (80%, 90%)
- [ ] Textarea allows line breaks and multi-line content
- [ ] Textarea resizing works properly

#### 2. Form Submission Testing

- [ ] Valid form data submits successfully
- [ ] Invalid form prevents submission (submit button disabled)
- [ ] Loading state shows during submission
- [ ] Form resets after successful submission
- [ ] Unsaved changes tracking works correctly
- [ ] Error handling displays store errors properly

#### 3. Modal Interaction Testing

- [ ] Modal opens centered with backdrop
- [ ] Modal closes on backdrop click (with unsaved changes confirmation)
- [ ] Modal closes on Escape key (with unsaved changes confirmation)
- [ ] Unsaved changes confirmation dialog works
- [ ] Modal prevents body scrolling when open

### Accessibility Testing

#### 4. Keyboard Navigation

- [ ] Tab order: name → description → system prompt → cancel → save
- [ ] Shift+Tab reverses navigation correctly
- [ ] Focus trapped within modal (doesn't escape)
- [ ] Initial focus on name field when modal opens
- [ ] Focus returns to trigger element when modal closes
- [ ] Enter key behavior appropriate for each field type
- [ ] Escape key closes modal with confirmation if needed

#### 5. Screen Reader Testing

- [ ] Field labels announced correctly
- [ ] Required field indicators announced
- [ ] Character counters announced on change
- [ ] Validation errors announced immediately
- [ ] Form submission results announced
- [ ] Modal open/close announced appropriately

#### 6. Visual Accessibility

- [ ] Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast for text and counters
- [ ] Error states clearly distinguishable
- [ ] Character counter colors provide sufficient contrast
- [ ] Loading states visible and clear

### User Experience Testing

#### 7. Edit Mode Testing

- [ ] Form pre-populates with existing role data
- [ ] Name uniqueness excludes current role
- [ ] All fields editable in edit mode
- [ ] Save button shows "Update Role" text
- [ ] Changes persist correctly to store

#### 8. Error Handling Testing

- [ ] Network errors display user-friendly messages
- [ ] Validation errors clear when fields become valid
- [ ] Multiple validation errors show simultaneously
- [ ] Error focus management works (focus moves to first error)
- [ ] Form remains usable after errors

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All field validations work correctly with appropriate error messages
- [ ] Form submission succeeds with valid data and includes all three fields
- [ ] Tab navigation follows expected order and focus management works
- [ ] Character counters function correctly with color feedback
- [ ] Edit mode properly pre-populates and updates existing roles
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors or runtime exceptions

## Implementation Approach

1. **Systematic Testing**: Work through each category methodically
2. **Bug Documentation**: Record any issues found with reproduction steps
3. **Fix Priority**: Address critical issues immediately, minor issues as needed
4. **Regression Testing**: Re-test after fixes to ensure no new issues
5. **User Acceptance**: Final validation that all requirements are met

## Dependencies

- Requires all previous implementation tasks to be completed
- Need access to development environment for testing
- May require bug fixes based on testing results
