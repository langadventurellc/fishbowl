# Enhance RoleListItem Visual Design

## Context

The RoleListItem component needs visual enhancements to create a "clean, scannable list format" with improved styling, better visual hierarchy, and enhanced user experience as specified in the feature requirements.

## Implementation Requirements

### Visual Design Improvements

- Enhance card shadows and borders for better visual distinction between roles
- Improve spacing and typography for better readability and hierarchy
- Add subtle background variations on hover for enhanced visual feedback
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility compliance
- Match design patterns from other settings sections (AgentsSection, etc.)

### Enhanced Styling

- Refine card hover states with smooth transitions (200ms)
- Improve button styling and positioning for better visual balance
- Add subtle focus rings for keyboard navigation accessibility
- Ensure consistent spacing and alignment across all card elements
- Implement proper text truncation with ellipsis for long descriptions

### Design Consistency

- Follow existing Tailwind theme variables and spacing
- Match color scheme and typography from other settings components
- Use consistent button variants and sizing across the interface
- Ensure visual hierarchy with proper heading and text sizes

## Technical Approach

### Styling Updates for RoleListItem

- Enhance `Card` component styling with better shadows and borders
- Improve hover state transitions using CSS variables for timing
- Add proper focus states for accessibility compliance
- Refine button group layout and spacing

### Key Style Properties

```typescript
// Enhanced card styling
className =
  "hover:shadow-md transition-all duration-200 border border-border/50 hover:border-border bg-card";

// Improved button styling
className = "h-8 px-3 transition-colors hover:bg-accent/10";
```

### Interaction Requirements

- [ ] Smooth hover animations that feel responsive and polished
- [ ] Focus states are clearly visible for keyboard navigation
