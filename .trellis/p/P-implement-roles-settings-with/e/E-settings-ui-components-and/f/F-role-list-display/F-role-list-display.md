# Role List Display Feature

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement the complete role list display component that shows all user-created roles with proper styling, actions, and responsive design. This feature transforms the existing list component to display live data with full interactivity and visual polish matching the design system.

## Key Components to Implement

### RolesList Component Enhancement

- Display dynamic roles data from the store
- Implement role cards/items with consistent styling
- Show role name, description preview, and action buttons
- Handle click interactions for edit and delete actions

### RoleListItem Component

- Create reusable list item component for individual roles
- Display role metadata (name, description, timestamps)
- Implement hover states and visual feedback
- Include edit and delete action buttons with icons

### List Layout and Styling

- Implement responsive grid or list layout
- Match existing settings sections visual design
- Ensure proper spacing and typography
- Add smooth animations for list updates

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Display Requirements

- [ ] Roles display in a clean, scannable list format
- [ ] Each role shows name prominently (title style)
- [ ] Description displays with truncation for long text (max 2 lines)
- [ ] Edit and Delete buttons visible for each role
- [ ] Visual distinction between roles (cards or separators)
- [ ] Smooth animations when roles are added/removed

### Interaction Requirements

- [ ] Edit button opens edit modal with role data
- [ ] Delete button opens confirmation dialog
- [ ] Entire role card/item is clickable for editing (optional)
- [ ] Hover states provide clear visual feedback
- [ ] Focus states for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Loading skeleton while data fetches

### Responsive Design

- [ ] List adapts to different window widths
- [ ] Maintains readability at minimum window size (800px)
- [ ] Action buttons remain accessible on smaller screens
- [ ] Text truncation adjusts based on available space

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture

- Separate container and presentation components
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Follow established component patterns

### Styling Requirements

- Use Tailwind classes consistently
- Match colors from existing theme
- Implement proper dark mode support if applicable
- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast ratios

### Data Handling

- Map store roles data to display components
- Handle empty array gracefully
- Sort roles by creation date or name
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists (50+ roles)

## Dependencies

- Requires F-roles-store-integration to be complete
- Uses existing button and card components from UI library
- Follows design patterns from other settings sections

## Testing Requirements

- Verify roles display correctly with various data sets
- Test edit/delete button interactions
- Validate responsive behavior at different sizes
- Confirm accessibility with screen readers
- Test performance with large numbers of roles

## Implementation Guidance

### Design Patterns to Follow

- Look at existing AgentsSection or PersonalitiesSection for list patterns
- Use consistent spacing variables from theme
- Follow established hover/focus state patterns
- Implement loading states similar to other sections

### Component Structure

```
<RolesList>
  <div className="space-y-4">
    {roles.map(role => (
      <RoleListItem
        key={role.id}
        role={role}
        onEdit={handleEdit}
        onDelete={handleDelete}
      />
    ))}
  </div>
</RolesList>
```

## Security Considerations

- Sanitize role names and descriptions before display
- Prevent XSS through proper React rendering
- Validate data types from store

## Performance Requirements

- List renders within 100ms for typical role counts (10-20)
- Smooth 60fps animations for all transitions
- Virtual scrolling activates for 50+ roles
- No layout shifts during data updates
