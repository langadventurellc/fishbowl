# Role Deletion with Confirmation Feature

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement safe role deletion functionality with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental data loss. The feature includes a clear warning message, role details in the confirmation, and proper error handling for deletion failures. This ensures users can remove unwanted roles while protecting against mistakes.

## Key Components to Implement

### RoleDeleteDialog Component

- Confirmation modal with warning styling
- Display role name being deleted
- Explain consequences of deletion
- Confirm and Cancel buttons with appropriate styling

### Deletion Flow

- Delete button triggers confirmation dialog
- Dialog shows role details for verification
- Confirm button executes deletion
- Loading state during deletion operation
- Success feedback and list update

### Error Handling

- Display errors if deletion fails
- Provide retry option for failures
- Handle edge cases (role not found, permissions)
- Rollback UI on failure

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Dialog Requirements

- [ ] Delete button on each role opens confirmation dialog
- [ ] Dialog displays warning icon or color (red/orange)
- [ ] Shows "Delete Role: [Role Name]" as title
- [ ] Message explains deletion is permanent
- [ ] Role name displayed prominently for confirmation
- [ ] Cancel button is default/safe option (left side)
- [ ] Delete button requires deliberate action (right side, danger style)

### Deletion Behavior

- [ ] Dialog prevents accidental clicks outside to close
- [ ] Escape key cancels deletion (safe default)
- [ ] Delete button in dialog shows loading during operation
- [ ] Successful deletion closes dialog automatically
- [ ] Role disappears from list with smooth animation
- [ ] Success toast/feedback shows briefly

### Error Handling

- [ ] Network errors show clear message
- [ ] File permission errors explained to user
- [ ] Retry button available for transient failures
- [ ] Dialog remains open on error for user action
- [ ] List remains unchanged if deletion fails

### Safety Features

- [ ] No deletion without explicit confirmation
- [ ] Clear visual distinction for destructive action
- [ ] Loading state prevents double-deletion
- [ ] Proper focus management in dialog

## Technical Requirements

### Dialog Implementation

```tsx
<RoleDeleteDialog
  isOpen={deleteDialogOpen}
  role={selectedRole}
  onConfirm={handleConfirmDelete}
  onCancel={handleCancelDelete}
  isLoading={isDeleting}
  error={deleteError}
/>
```

### Store Integration

- Call store.deleteRole with role ID
- Handle async operation properly
- Update UI optimistically if appropriate
- Rollback on failure

### Visual Design

- Use danger/destructive variant for delete button
- Warning icon or background in dialog
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Sufficient contrast for accessibility

## Dependencies

- Requires F-roles-store-integration for delete operation
- Uses dialog components from UI library
- Follows deletion patterns from other settings

## Testing Requirements

- Test confirmation dialog opens correctly
- Verify role name displays in confirmation
- Confirm successful deletion flow
- Test error scenarios and recovery
- Validate keyboard navigation works
- Ensure dialog closes appropriately

## Implementation Guidance

### Dialog Content Structure

```tsx
<AlertDialog>
  <AlertDialogContent>
    <AlertDialogHeader>
      <AlertDialogTitle>Delete Role: {role.name}</AlertDialogTitle>
      <AlertDialogDescription>
        Are you sure you want to delete this role? This action cannot be undone.
        Role details: • Name: {role.name}• Description: {role.description}•
        Created: {formatDate(role.createdAt)}
      </AlertDialogDescription>
    </AlertDialogHeader>
    <AlertDialogFooter>
      <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
      <AlertDialogAction variant="destructive" onClick={onConfirm}>
        Delete Role
      </AlertDialogAction>
    </AlertDialogFooter>
  </AlertDialogContent>
</AlertDialog>
```

### Deletion Handler

```typescript
const handleConfirmDelete = async () => {
  setIsDeleting(true);
  try {
    await store.deleteRole(selectedRole.id);
    toast.success("Role deleted successfully");
    setDeleteDialogOpen(false);
  } catch (error) {
    setDeleteError(error.message);
  } finally {
    setIsDeleting(false);
  }
};
```

## Security Considerations

- Verify user has permission to delete roles
- Log deletion actions for audit trail
- Prevent deletion of system/default roles if applicable
- Sanitize role data displayed in confirmation

## Performance Requirements

- Dialog opens instantly (<50ms)
- Deletion completes within 1 second
- UI updates immediately after confirmation
- No memory leaks from event handlers
