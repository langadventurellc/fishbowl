    Connected component to useRolesStore hook - replaced SAMPLE_ROLES import
    with useRolesStore, added store state subscriptions (roles, isLoading,
    error), implemented loading state UI with spinner, added error state display
    with styling, created empty state with helpful messaging and create button,
    updated RolesList to use live roles data, added performance optimization
    with useMemo, and added required icon imports (UserPlus, Plus) and Button
    component import
log:
  - Successfully connected RolesSection component to useRolesStore hook,
    replacing static SAMPLE_ROLES with live store data. Implemented complete
    state management including loading spinner, error display, empty state with
    helpful messaging, and optimized re-renders with proper React patterns.
    Component now reactively displays store data and provides excellent UX for
    all states (loading, error, empty, populated). All quality checks pass with
    no lint, format, or type errors.

# Connect RolesSection component to useRolesStore hook

## Context

Replace static `SAMPLE_ROLES` data in `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/roles/RolesSection.tsx` with live data from the `useRolesStore` hook. This establishes the fundamental data connection between UI and store.

## Technical Approach

- Import `useRolesStore` from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
- Remove `SAMPLE_ROLES` import and usage
- Subscribe to `store.roles` for role data display
- Subscribe to `store.isLoading` for loading state management
- Subscribe to `store.error` for error state display
- Use React.useMemo() or zustand selectors to optimize re-renders
- Follow React best practices for store subscriptions

## Implementation Details

Replace this pattern:

```jsx
// Current
import { SAMPLE_ROLES } from "@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared";
<RolesList roles={SAMPLE_ROLES} ... />
```

With:

```jsx
// New
import { useRolesStore } from "@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared";
const roles = useRolesStore((state) => state.roles);
const isLoading = useRolesStore((state) => state.isLoading);
const error = useRolesStore((state) => state.error);
<RolesList roles={roles} ... />
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] RolesSection reads role data from `store.roles`, not `SAMPLE_ROLES`
- [ ] Loading state displays when `store.isLoading` is true
- [ ] Error states from store display appropriately in UI
- [ ] Component re-renders automatically when store state changes
- [ ] No memory leaks from store subscriptions
- [ ] Store selectors used to minimize unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Unit tests verify component connects to store correctly
- [ ] Integration tests confirm UI updates when store data changes

## Dependencies

- Requires store initialization task to be completed first
- Must maintain compatibility with existing `RolesList` component props

## Security Considerations

- Validate all data from store before rendering
- Sanitize any error messages before displaying to user
- Ensure no sensitive data exposed in development logs

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for store subscription and data display
- Test loading state rendering during store operations
- Verify error state displays when store has errors
- Confirm component properly unmounts and cleans up subscriptions
- Test that UI updates reflect store changes immediately
