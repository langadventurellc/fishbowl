# Roles Store Integration Feature

## Purpose and Functionality

Connect the existing roles UI components to the Zustand store in `ui-shared`, replacing the static SAMPLE_ROLES data with live data from the store. This establishes the fundamental data flow between UI and business logic, enabling all CRUD operations to work with persisted data.

## Key Components to Implement

### Store Initialization and Provider Setup

- Initialize the roles store with the desktop adapter in the application startup
- Ensure the RolesProvider wraps the settings modal components
- Configure proper error boundaries for store operations
- Set up store initialization on app launch

### Component Store Connections

- Connect RolesSection component to useRolesStore hook
- Replace SAMPLE_ROLES references with store.roles data
- Wire up loading states from store.isLoading
- Connect error states from store.error for display

### State Management Patterns

- Implement proper React patterns for store subscription
- Ensure components re-render appropriately on store changes
- Handle async state updates correctly
- Manage component unmount cleanup

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Store Initialization

- [ ] Roles store initializes with desktop adapter on app startup
- [ ] Initial data loads from roles.json file if it exists
- [ ] Store initialization errors handled gracefully with fallback
- [ ] Loading state displays during initial data fetch
- [ ] Store state persists across settings modal open/close

### Data Flow Requirements

- [ ] RolesSection reads roles data from store.roles, not SAMPLE_ROLES
- [ ] All CRUD operations update the store state immediately
- [ ] Store changes trigger UI re-renders automatically
- [ ] Optimistic updates show changes before persistence completes
- [ ] Error states from store display in UI appropriately

### Integration Points

- [ ] useRolesStore hook properly imported and used in components
- [ ] Store adapter configured with desktop file operations
- [ ] Store initialization happens once at app level, not per component
- [ ] Memory leaks prevented with proper cleanup on unmount

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Patterns

- Use the existing useRolesStore hook from ui-shared
- Follow React best practices for store subscriptions
- Implement error boundaries for store failures
- Ensure TypeScript types align between store and components

### Performance Considerations

- Minimize unnecessary re-renders with proper React.memo usage
- Use selector patterns to subscribe to specific store slices
- Debounce rapid state changes appropriately
- Lazy load role data only when settings modal opens

## Dependencies

- Requires working desktop adapter (from E-desktop-integration-and)
- Must maintain compatibility with existing component props
- Follows established store patterns in the codebase

## Testing Requirements

- Verify store initializes with desktop adapter correctly
- Test that UI updates when store state changes
- Confirm error states display appropriately
- Validate loading states during async operations
- Test store persistence across app restarts

## Security Considerations

- Store should not expose sensitive file paths in errors
- Validate all data from store before rendering
- Sanitize any user input before store operations

## Performance Requirements

- Store initialization completes within 200ms
- UI updates within 16ms of store changes (60fps)
- No memory leaks from store subscriptions
