# Verify Update Operation and Optimistic Updates

## Context

The role editing feature requires robust update operations that save changes to the store, handle errors gracefully, and provide optimal user experience through optimistic updates. We need to verify the existing implementation meets all requirements.

## Implementation Requirements

### Update Operation Verification

- [ ] Verify `updateRole` function is called correctly with role ID and updated data
- [ ] Test that only changed fields are sent to update operation (if applicable)
- [ ] Confirm `updatedAt` timestamp is properly updated during save operation
- [ ] Ensure role list refreshes to show updated values immediately

### Optimistic Updates Implementation

- [ ] Verify UI updates immediately when user submits form (before server response)
- [ ] Test that optimistic updates are reverted if save operation fails
- [ ] Ensure loading states are properly managed during update operations
- [ ] Confirm error handling works when optimistic updates fail

### Error Handling and Recovery

- [ ] Test update operation failure scenarios and error display
- [ ] Verify form remains open when save operations fail
- [ ] Ensure user data is preserved when errors occur
- [ ] Test retry functionality after failed updates

## Technical Implementation

### Store Integration

```typescript
// Verify this update logic works correctly
if (selectedRole?.id) {
  updateRole(selectedRole.id, data);

  // Check if update succeeded by checking error state
  const currentError = useRolesStore.getState().error;
  if (!currentError?.message) {
    // Success path
    setFormModalOpen(false);
    setSelectedRole(undefined);
  }
}
```

### Loading State Management

- [ ] Verify `isLoading` prop is passed correctly to form components
- [ ] Test that form fields are disabled during save operations
- [ ] Ensure submit button shows loading indicator ("Saving..." text with spinner)
- [ ] Confirm cancel button behavior during loading states

### Data Consistency

- [ ] Verify role list updates reflect changes immediately after successful save
- [ ] Test that concurrent edit operations are handled appropriately
- [ ] Ensure data integrity is maintained throughout update process
- [ ] Verify no race conditions exist in update flow

## User Experience Requirements

### Immediate Feedback

- [ ] Test that users receive immediate visual feedback when save is triggered
- [ ] Verify modal closes only after successful update operation
- [ ] Ensure appropriate success messaging or indication
- [ ] Test that form state is properly reset after successful save

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Verify updates complete within 500ms as specified in requirements
- [ ] Test that UI remains responsive during update operations
- [ ] Ensure no UI freezing occurs during save operations
- [ ] Verify smooth transitions between loading and completed states

### Error User Experience

- [ ] Test that error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Verify users can retry after errors without losing data
- [ ] Ensure form validation errors are distinguished from save errors
- [ ] Test accessibility of error messages and states

## Testing Requirements

### Success Scenarios

- [ ] Test successful update with minimal changes
- [ ] Verify successful update with all fields modified
- [ ] Test update operation with maximum length content
- [ ] Verify successful update preserves unmodified fields

### Failure Scenarios

- [ ] Mock network failures and test error handling
- [ ] Test validation failures during save operation
- [ ] Verify behavior when role is deleted by another user during edit
- [ ] Test concurrent modification scenarios

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Test update operation with special characters in role data
- [ ] Verify handling of very large system prompt content
- [ ] Test update operation after long idle periods
- [ ] Verify behavior when browser storage is full

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Measure actual update operation timing
- [ ] Test with large numbers of existing roles
- [ ] Verify memory usage during update operations
- [ ] Test responsiveness with slow network conditions

## Files to Verify/Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/roles/RolesSection.tsx:87-137` (handleSaveRole)
- `packages/shared/src/stores/useRolesStore.ts` (updateRole implementation)
- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/roles/CreateRoleForm.tsx:71-87` (save handling)

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Verify role ownership validation if implementing user-specific roles
- [ ] Ensure role ID cannot be modified during edit operation
- [ ] Test that only authorized updates are processed
- [ ] Verify input sanitization for all modified data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Updates save to store successfully with proper error handling
- [ ] Only changed fields are processed in update operation
- [ ] Timestamps update appropriately (updatedAt field)
- [ ] Role list refreshes to show updated values immediately
- [ ] Modal closes only on successful update
- [ ] Optimistic updates provide smooth user experience
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully with clear feedback

## Definition of Done

- All update operation requirements are verified and working correctly
- Optimistic updates provide excellent user experience
- Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- Performance meets specified requirements (<500ms)
- Comprehensive test coverage for all update scenarios
- No regressions in existing functionality
