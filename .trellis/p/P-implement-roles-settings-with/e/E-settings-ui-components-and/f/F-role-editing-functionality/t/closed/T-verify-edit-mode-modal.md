# Verify Edit Mode Modal Behavior and Validation

## Context

The role editing functionality is largely implemented, but we need to verify that all edit mode behaviors work correctly according to the acceptance criteria. This includes modal behavior, form pre-population, and validation rules.

## Implementation Requirements

### Modal Behavior Verification

- [ ] Verify edit button on role list items opens modal in edit mode
- [ ] Confirm modal title shows "Edit Role" when `mode="edit"`
- [ ] Verify submit button shows "Update Role" text in edit mode
- [ ] Ensure all form fields pre-populate with current role values accurately
- [ ] Test that character counters show correct current length for pre-populated data

### Validation in Edit Mode

- [ ] Verify name uniqueness validation excludes current role from duplicate check
- [ ] Confirm form starts in valid state if existing data meets validation rules
- [ ] Test that validation runs correctly on pre-populated data
- [ ] Ensure all existing validation rules still apply in edit mode

### Form State Management

- [ ] Verify `isDirty` state correctly tracks whether any fields have changed from original values
- [ ] Test that submit button is disabled when no changes are made (`!isDirty`)
- [ ] Confirm original values are preserved for comparison throughout edit session

## Technical Verification Points

### Component Integration

```typescript
// Verify these props are correctly passed to CreateRoleForm
<CreateRoleForm
  mode="edit"
  initialData={selectedRole}
  // ... other props
/>
```

### Name Uniqueness Logic

```typescript
// Verify currentRoleId is properly calculated and passed
const currentRoleId =
  isEditMode && initialData
    ? (initialData as RoleViewModel & { id?: string }).id
    : undefined;
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Edit modal opens with all fields correctly pre-populated
- [ ] Modal title and button text reflect edit mode appropriately
- [ ] Name validation excludes current role from uniqueness check
- [ ] Form state management prevents submission when no changes made
- [ ] All character counters display accurate values for existing content

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Create unit tests for edit mode modal behavior
- [ ] Test form validation in edit mode scenarios
- [ ] Verify edge cases (empty fields, max length content, etc.)
- [ ] Test accessibility features work correctly in edit mode

## Files to Verify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/roles/RoleFormModal.tsx:144-149`
- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/roles/CreateRoleForm.tsx:54,100-103,202`
- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/roles/RoleNameInput.tsx` (name validation)

## Definition of Done

- All edit mode behaviors match acceptance criteria exactly
- Form validation works correctly with existing role data
- No regressions in create mode functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage for edit mode scenarios
