# Implement and Test Change Detection and Unsaved Changes Warning

## Context

The role editing feature requires sophisticated change detection to track modifications and warn users about unsaved changes. While basic `isDirty` functionality exists, we need to enhance and thoroughly test the change detection system.

## Implementation Requirements

### Enhanced Change Detection

- [ ] Verify change detection works at field level for all form fields (name, description, systemPrompt)
- [ ] Ensure `isDirty` state accurately reflects any modifications from original values
- [ ] Test change detection with various scenarios (whitespace changes, case changes, etc.)
- [ ] Implement visual indicators when fields differ from saved values

### Unsaved Changes Warning System

- [ ] Verify unsaved changes warning appears when user attempts to close modal with modifications
- [ ] Test that warning correctly identifies what constitutes "unsaved changes"
- [ ] Ensure warning provides clear options: "Close Without Saving" and "Continue Editing"
- [ ] Verify warning does not appear when no changes have been made

### Form State Reset Behavior

- [ ] Test that original values are restored when user cancels edit operation
- [ ] Verify form reset works correctly after successful save operation
- [ ] Ensure `isDirty` state is properly cleared after save or cancel operations

## Technical Implementation

### Change Detection Logic

```typescript
// Verify this logic works correctly for all field types
const hasChanges = useMemo(() => {
  if (!originalData) return true; // New role
  return (
    originalData.name !== currentData.name ||
    originalData.description !== currentData.description ||
    originalData.systemPrompt !== currentData.systemPrompt
  );
}, [originalData, currentData]);
```

### React Hook Form Integration

- [ ] Verify `formState.isDirty` correctly tracks changes from `defaultValues`
- [ ] Test that `reset()` function works properly with original data
- [ ] Ensure `watch()` functionality tracks changes appropriately
- [ ] Confirm `getFieldState()` provides accurate dirty state per field

### Unsaved Changes Hook Integration

```typescript
// Verify integration with useUnsavedChanges hook
useEffect(() => {
  setUnsavedChanges(form.formState.isDirty);
}, [form.formState.isDirty, setUnsavedChanges]);
```

## User Experience Requirements

### Change Indication

- [ ] Implement visual indication when form has unsaved changes
- [ ] Consider field-level indicators showing which specific fields were modified
- [ ] Ensure submit button state reflects change status appropriately
- [ ] Test that users can clearly understand their change status

### Warning Dialog Enhancement

- [ ] Verify warning dialog is accessible and properly announced to screen readers
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation within warning dialog
- [ ] Ensure warning text is clear and actionable
- [ ] Verify dialog focus management works correctly

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Test change detection with various data combinations
- [ ] Verify `isDirty` state transitions correctly
- [ ] Test form reset functionality with different scenarios
- [ ] Mock unsaved changes warning scenarios

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Test complete edit flow with unsaved changes warning
- [ ] Verify warning appears/disappears appropriately during user interaction
- [ ] Test edge cases: rapid changes, programmatic updates, etc.
- [ ] Verify interaction between change detection and form validation

### User Experience Tests

- [ ] Test with screen readers to ensure accessibility
- [ ] Verify keyboard navigation works throughout change detection flow
- [ ] Test mobile/touch interaction with change detection features

## Performance Considerations

- [ ] Ensure change detection doesn't cause unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Optimize field-level change tracking for performance
- [ ] Test with large system prompt content to ensure responsiveness

## Files to Modify/Verify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/roles/CreateRoleForm.tsx:67-69,90-98`
- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/roles/RoleFormModal.tsx:69-84`
- `packages/ui-shared/src/hooks/useUnsavedChanges.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Change detection accurately identifies modifications in all form fields
- [ ] Unsaved changes warning appears only when appropriate
- [ ] Form state resets correctly on cancel or successful save
- [ ] Visual feedback clearly communicates change status to users
- [ ] No performance issues with change detection system
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all change detection scenarios

## Definition of Done

- All change detection requirements from feature specification are implemented
- Users receive clear feedback about unsaved changes
- Warning system prevents accidental data loss
- Performance remains optimal during change tracking
- Full test coverage with edge cases
