# Settings UI Components and Integration Epic

## Purpose and Goals

Implement the complete user interface for roles management within the existing settings modal, ensuring consistent design patterns and user experience with other settings sections. This epic delivers the final user-facing functionality that allows users to create, edit, and delete roles through an intuitive interface.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### Settings UI Components (`apps/desktop`)

- **Roles Section**: Main roles settings section integrated into settings modal
- **Role Form**: Create/edit form with proper validation and error handling
- **Roles List**: Display existing roles with edit/delete actions
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Delete confirmation and unsaved changes warnings
- **Empty States**: Helpful messaging when no roles exist

### Integration and UX

- **Settings Modal Integration**: Seamless integration with existing settings navigation
- **Consistent Styling**: Match design patterns from general/appearance/advanced settings
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **Loading States**: Progress indicators during async operations
- **Responsive Design**: Proper layout across different window sizes

### Component Architecture

- **Component Separation**: Clean separation between container and presentation components
- **State Management**: Proper integration with roles store
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling for component failures
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### UI Component Requirements

- [ ] **Roles Section Integration**: Roles section appears in settings modal with consistent navigation
- [ ] **Role Creation Form**: Modal or inline form for creating new roles with all required fields
- [ ] **Role Editing Form**: In-place or modal editing with pre-populated values
- [ ] **Role Deletion**: Delete button with confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion
- [ ] **Roles List Display**: Clean list view of all roles with actions (edit/delete)
- [ ] **Empty State**: Helpful messaging and create action when no roles exist

### Form Validation and UX Requirements

- [ ] **Real-time Validation**: Form fields validate as user types with immediate feedback
- [ ] **Error Display**: Clear error messages for validation failures (character limits, required fields)
- [ ] **Unsaved Changes**: Warning dialog when user tries to leave form with unsaved changes
- [ ] **Field Constraints**: Name (1-100 chars), description (max 500), system prompt (1-5000) enforced
- [ ] **Success Feedback**: Clear confirmation when roles are successfully saved
- [ ] **Loading Indicators**: Spinner/progress during save/load operations

### Integration Requirements

- [ ] **Settings Navigation**: Roles tab/section accessible from main settings navigation
- [ ] **Consistent Styling**: Matches visual design of other settings sections exactly
- [ ] **Responsive Layout**: Works properly on different window sizes and aspect ratios
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all role management tasks
- [ ] **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling in forms and modals

### State Management Integration

- [ ] **Store Connection**: Components properly connected to roles Zustand store
- [ ] **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with rollback on errors
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Store errors display as user-friendly messages
- [ ] **Loading States**: UI reflects loading states from async operations
- [ ] **State Persistence**: Form state preserved during navigation within settings

## Technical Considerations

### Component Architecture Patterns

- Follow existing settings component patterns exactly
- Use same form handling patterns as other settings sections
- Maintain consistent error handling and validation approaches
- Integrate with existing component library and design system

### Form Handling Strategy

- Use same form validation patterns as other settings
- Implement proper controlled/uncontrolled input handling
- Handle form state during async operations
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions

### Accessibility Requirements

- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation for all functionality
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management for modals and forms

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: E-desktop-integration-and (working persistence layer required)
- **Dependents**: None - this completes the roles implementation

## Estimated Scale

- **Files to Create**: 5-7 new UI component files
- **Files to Modify**: 1-2 existing settings files (for integration)
- **Files to Delete**: 3-5 old demo component files
- **Estimated Features**: 5-8 features

## User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to access role settings through the main settings modal so it's easy to find
- **As a user**, I want to create new roles with clear forms so I can customize AI behavior
- **As a user**, I want to edit existing roles so I can refine them over time
- **As a user**, I want confirmation before deleting roles so I don't lose work accidentally
- **As a user**, I want clear error messages when forms are invalid so I can fix issues
- **As a user**, I want the roles interface to match other settings so it feels consistent
- **As a user**, I want helpful guidance when I have no roles so I know how to get started

## Non-functional Requirements

### User Experience

- Settings modal opens to roles section when accessed via roles-related actions
- Form interactions feel responsive with immediate feedback
- Loading states provide clear indication of progress
- Error messages are helpful and actionable, not technical
- Empty states guide users toward creating their first role

### Performance

- Settings modal renders without delay when switching to roles section
- Form validation responds within 50ms of user input
- Large numbers of roles (50+) display without performance degradation
- Component re-renders optimized to prevent unnecessary updates

### Accessibility

- Full keyboard navigation support for all role management tasks
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- High contrast support for visually impaired users
- Focus indicators visible and properly managed
- Form validation errors announced to assistive technologies

### Design Consistency

- Visual design matches existing settings sections exactly
- Typography, spacing, colors follow established design system
- Form patterns consistent with other settings forms
- Error handling visual patterns match rest of application
- Loading states consistent with application-wide patterns

## Integration Points

### With Existing Settings Infrastructure

- Uses same settings modal navigation patterns
- Integrates with existing settings routing/navigation
- Follows same styling and component patterns
- Uses existing form validation and error handling patterns

### With Shared Business Logic Epic

- Connects to roles store for all data operations
- Uses mapping functions for data transformation
- Integrates with error handling and loading states
- Follows established state management patterns

### With Desktop Integration Epic

- Relies on working file persistence for save/load operations
- Displays appropriate errors for file operation failures
- Handles initialization and default data scenarios

## Success Metrics

- Users can successfully navigate to roles settings from main settings menu
- All CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) work through the UI
- Form validation provides clear feedback and prevents invalid submissions
- UI performance remains responsive with typical numbers of roles (10-20)
- Visual design maintains consistency with other settings sections
- Accessibility standards met for keyboard and screen reader users
- Error conditions display helpful messages that guide users to resolution
