log:
  - "Completed comprehensive dependency analysis for legacy roles code cleanup.
    Identified all import references for 5 files scheduled for deletion, created
    detailed dependency map with impact assessment, and documented safe deletion
    strategy. Key findings: 4/5 files have minimal impact (only test
    dependencies), rolesPersistence.ts requires careful handling due to active
    usage in rolesStore.ts. No external barrel export usage found, making
    cleanup operation low-risk. Documented specific lines to update and files to
    delete."

# Task: Analyze and Document Import Dependencies

## Context

Before deleting legacy role-related files, we need to identify all components and modules that import these files to ensure a safe cleanup process. This task creates a comprehensive map of dependencies that will guide the cleanup process.

## Files to Analyze for Dependencies

- `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/rolesPersistence.ts`
- `packages/ui-shared/src/utils/getRoleCategories.ts`
- `packages/ui-shared/src/utils/getRolesByCategory.ts`
- `packages/ui-shared/src/utils/isPredefinedRole.ts`
- `packages/ui-shared/src/utils/isValidPredefinedRole.ts`

## Implementation Steps

1. **Search for Import References**
   - Use ripgrep/grep to find all imports of each file to be deleted
   - Search across all packages (desktop, mobile, shared, ui-shared)
   - Document each importing file and the specific import statement

2. **Create Dependency Map**
   - Create a temporary markdown file documenting:
     - Each file to be deleted
     - List of files importing it
     - The specific functions/types being imported
     - Whether the import is critical or can be safely removed

3. **Analyze Impact**
   - For each importing file, determine:
     - If the functionality can be removed entirely
     - If replacement logic is needed
     - If the component needs refactoring

4. **Document Test Files**
   - Identify test files for utilities being deleted:
     - `packages/ui-shared/src/utils/__tests__/getRoleCategories.test.ts`
     - `packages/ui-shared/src/utils/__tests__/getRolesByCategory.test.ts`
     - `packages/ui-shared/src/utils/__tests__/isPredefinedRole.test.ts`
     - `packages/ui-shared/src/utils/__tests__/isValidPredefinedRole.test.ts`
   - These will also need deletion

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete list of all files importing the 5 utilities to be deleted
- [ ] Dependency map created documenting all imports and their usage
- [ ] Test files identified for deletion
- [ ] Impact analysis completed for each importing file
- [ ] Documentation includes specific line numbers and import statements
- [ ] No missing dependencies that could cause compilation errors

## Technical Approach

```bash
# Example search commands to use
rg "import.*rolesPersistence" --type ts --type tsx
rg "import.*getRoleCategories" --type ts --type tsx
rg "import.*getRolesByCategory" --type ts --type tsx
rg "import.*isPredefinedRole" --type ts --type tsx
rg "import.*isValidPredefinedRole" --type ts --type tsx
```

## Testing Requirements

- Verify all imports have been identified by running TypeScript compilation
- Ensure no hidden or dynamic imports were missed
- Document findings in a structured format for reference

## Estimated Time

1 hour - This is primarily an analysis and documentation task
