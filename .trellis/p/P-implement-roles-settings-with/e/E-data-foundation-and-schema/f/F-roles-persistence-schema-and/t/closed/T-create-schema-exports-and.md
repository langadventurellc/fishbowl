# Create Schema Exports and Integration Task

## Context and Background

This task creates the barrel export file and ensures proper integration of all roles schema components with the existing settings system. It provides clean public APIs for other packages to import roles types and schemas while maintaining consistency with existing patterns.

**Related Objects:**

- **Feature**: F-roles-persistence-schema-and (Roles Persistence Schema and Types)
- **Epic**: E-data-foundation-and-schema (Data Foundation and Schema Design)
- **Project**: P-implement-roles-settings-with (Implement Roles Settings with JSON File Persistence)
- **Dependencies**: All previous tasks must complete (individual schema, file structure, default factory)

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### Barrel Export File Creation

Create `packages/shared/src/types/settings/index.ts` and add roles exports (or extend existing file if it exists).

### Exports to Include

```typescript
// Re-export all roles-related schemas and types
export {
  persistedRoleSchema,
  persistedRolesSettingsSchema,
  CURRENT_ROLES_SCHEMA_VERSION,
  ROLES_SCHEMA_VERSION,
  type PersistedRoleData,
  type PersistedRolesSettingsData,
} from "./rolesSettingsSchema";

export { createDefaultRolesSettings } from "./createDefaultRolesSettings";
```

## Technical Approach to Follow

1. **Research Existing Export Patterns**: Examine existing `packages/shared/src/types/settings/index.ts` (if exists)
2. **Create or Extend Barrel File**: Add roles exports following established conventions

### Pattern Research Required

- How other settings schemas are exported from `packages/shared`
- Naming conventions for schema exports vs type exports
- Whether separate index files exist or if there's one main index
- How version constants are handled in exports

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Export Structure Requirements

- [ ] **Clean Public API**: All necessary schemas, types, and functions exported
- [ ] **Consistent Naming**: Export names follow existing settings patterns
- [ ] **Type-Only Exports**: TypeScript types exported with `type` keyword where appropriate
- [ ] **Version Constants**: Schema version constants available for import

### Cross-Package Integration

- [ ] **UI-Shared Imports**: Types can be imported from `@fishbowl-ai/shared` in ui-shared package
- [ ] **Desktop Imports**: Schemas can be imported in desktop application
- [ ] **Clean Import Paths**: Imports work with package name rather than deep paths
- [ ] **TypeScript Resolution**: All imports resolve correctly during compilation

### Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] **Existing Settings Integration**: Roles exports don't conflict with other settings
- [ ] **Build System Compatibility**: Exports work with monorepo build system
- [ ] **Development Experience**: IDE auto-completion works for exported types
- [ ] **Documentation**: Exported APIs are properly documented

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: All other tasks in this feature (schemas and factory must exist)
- **Dependents**: Next feature (legacy cleanup) will rely on these exports

## Performance Requirements

### Export Performance

- Barrel exports don't significantly impact bundle size
- Import resolution doesn't slow down TypeScript compilation
- No circular dependencies that could impact build performance

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All roles schemas and types available via clean package imports
- [ ] Cross-package TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- [ ] No circular dependencies introduced by new exports
- [ ] Build system processes exports correctly in all configurations
- [ ] Export structure consistent with existing settings patterns

## Future Considerations

This export structure should be designed to support:

- Additional role-related schemas in the future
- Schema versioning and migration utilities
- Enhanced validation or transformation functions
