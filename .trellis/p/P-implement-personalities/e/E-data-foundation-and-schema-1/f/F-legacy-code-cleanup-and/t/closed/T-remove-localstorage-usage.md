# Remove localStorage Usage from Personalities

## Context

Systematically remove all localStorage references related to personalities from the codebase to prepare for file-based persistence. This includes storage utilities, form persistence, and any backup/restore mechanisms.

## Implementation Requirements

### Files to Search and Clean

Search the entire codebase for localStorage references related to personalities:

1. **Form Components**:
   - `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/CreatePersonalityForm.tsx`
   - Any personality form components with localStorage persistence

2. **Utility Functions**:
   - `packages/ui-shared/src/utils/` - Remove localStorage utility functions
   - `packages/ui-shared/src/hooks/` - Remove localStorage hooks

3. **Storage Keys**:
   - Remove any localStorage keys for personalities
   - Remove personality-related storage constants

### Specific localStorage Operations to Remove

- `localStorage.getItem()` calls for personality data
- `localStorage.setItem()` calls for personality data
- `localStorage.removeItem()` calls for personality data
- `localStorage.clear()` related to personalities
- Any localStorage backup/restore functionality

### Code Patterns to Look For

```typescript
// Remove patterns like these:
localStorage.getItem('personalities')
localStorage.setItem('personality-draft', ...)
localStorage.removeItem('saved-personalities')

// Remove utility functions like:
const savePersonalityToLocalStorage = ...
const loadPersonalityFromLocalStorage = ...
const clearPersonalityStorage = ...
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No references to `localStorage.getItem()` for personalities remain
- [ ] No references to `localStorage.setItem()` for personalities remain
- [ ] No references to `localStorage.removeItem()` for personalities remain
- [ ] No localStorage keys related to personalities exist
- [ ] localStorage utility functions removed if no longer used elsewhere
- [ ] No localStorage backup/restore functionality remains
- [ ] Search codebase confirms no personality localStorage usage
- [ ] Application builds successfully after removal
- [ ] No console errors from missing localStorage data
- [ ] Unit tests updated to remove localStorage-related test cases

## Search Strategy

1. **Global Search**: Search entire codebase for "localStorage" and verify each usage
2. **Personality Context**: Focus on personality-related files and components
3. **Utility Review**: Check shared utilities that might use localStorage
4. **Test Files**: Update or remove localStorage-related tests

## Verification Steps

- Run global search for "localStorage" in codebase
- Verify no personality-related localStorage usage remains
- Check that application starts without localStorage errors
- Confirm no localStorage keys are created during personality interactions

## Testing Requirements (include in this task)

- Test application starts without localStorage data
- Test personality forms work without localStorage persistence
- Test no console errors related to missing localStorage
- Update unit tests to remove localStorage expectations
- Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds

## Breaking Changes Documentation

Document any utilities or functions being removed that might affect other features:

- List removed localStorage utility functions
- Note any shared hooks that are being removed
- Identify any localStorage keys that other features might depend on

## Dependencies

- Review existing personality components to understand localStorage usage patterns
- Ensure no other features depend on personality localStorage utilities before removal
