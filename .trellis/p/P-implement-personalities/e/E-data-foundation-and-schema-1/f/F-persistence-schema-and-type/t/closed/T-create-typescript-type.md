log:
  - Successfully created TypeScript type definitions derived from personality
    schemas. Implemented PersistedPersonalityData and
    PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData types following the exact pattern from
    roles implementation. Created comprehensive unit tests with 11 test cases
    covering type compatibility, schema inference, edge cases, and export
    functionality. All quality checks pass with proper TypeScript types,
    linting, and formatting. Types are properly exported through index.ts for
    use in ui-shared and desktop packages.

# Create TypeScript Type Definitions from Schemas

## Context

Create clean TypeScript type definitions derived from the Zod schemas, following the pattern established in the roles implementation. These types will be used throughout the ui-shared and desktop packages.

## Implementation Requirements

### File: `packages/shared/src/types/settings/PersistedPersonalityData.ts`

Create individual personality type definition:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { persistedPersonalitySchema } from "./personalitiesSettingsSchema";

/**
 * Type definition for a single persisted personality
 * Derived from Zod schema for type safety
 */
export type PersistedPersonalityData = z.infer<
  typeof persistedPersonalitySchema
>;
```

### File: `packages/shared/src/types/settings/PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData.ts`

Create complete file structure type:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { persistedPersonalitiesSettingsSchema } from "./personalitiesSettingsSchema";

/**
 * Type definition for the complete personalities settings file structure
 * Includes schema version, personalities array, and metadata
 */
export type PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData = z.infer<
  typeof persistedPersonalitiesSettingsSchema
>;
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Both type files created at exact paths in `packages/shared/src/types/settings/`
- [ ] Types properly inferred from Zod schemas using `z.infer<typeof schema>`
- [ ] Comprehensive JSDoc documentation on all exported types
- [ ] No `any` types used anywhere
- [ ] Types export correctly for import in other packages
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
- [ ] Follow exact naming patterns from roles implementation
- [ ] Unit tests verify type correctness and schema compatibility

## Dependencies

- Requires T-create-core-zod-schemas-for to be completed first
- Review corresponding files in roles implementation for pattern consistency

## Testing Requirements (include in this task)

- Test that types match schema validation exactly
- Verify type exports work correctly
- Test type compatibility with expected data structures
- Ensure no TypeScript errors when using types
