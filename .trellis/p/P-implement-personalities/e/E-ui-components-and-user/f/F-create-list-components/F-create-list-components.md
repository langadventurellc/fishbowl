# Create PersonalitiesList and PersonalityCard Components

## Purpose and Goals

Create the new list view components that display all personalities in a unified interface. This includes the PersonalitiesList container, individual PersonalityCard components, and an EmptyState component for when no personalities exist.

## Key Components to Implement

### PersonalitiesList Component

- Grid/list container for personality cards
- Handles empty state rendering
- Accepts personalities array, onEdit, and onDelete callbacks
- Responsive layout with proper spacing

### PersonalityCard Component

- Displays individual personality information
- Shows name, Big Five traits summary, behavior count
- Includes Edit and Delete action buttons
- Uses Card component from shadcn/ui
- Matches RoleCard visual design

### EmptyState Component

- Helpful message when no personalities exist
- Prominent "Create your first personality" call-to-action
- Icon and descriptive text
- Follows app's empty state patterns

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### PersonalitiesList Requirements

- [ ] Renders grid of PersonalityCard components
- [ ] Shows EmptyState when personalities array is empty
- [ ] Passes edit/delete handlers to cards

- [ ] Proper spacing between cards (gap-4)
- [ ] Handles loading state appropriately

### PersonalityCard Requirements

- [ ] Displays personality name prominently
- [ ] Shows Big Five trait averages or key traits
- [ ] Displays behavior trait count
- [ ] Custom instructions preview (truncated)
- [ ] Edit button with Pencil icon
- [ ] Delete button with Trash icon
- [ ] Hover states on action buttons
- [ ] Card uses consistent padding and shadows

### EmptyState Requirements

- [ ] Clear message: "No personalities yet"
- [ ] Helpful subtext explaining personalities purpose
- [ ] Large, prominent create button
- [ ] Uses muted colors for text
- [ ] Centers content appropriately
- [ ] Matches other empty states in app

### Visual Requirements

- [ ] Cards match Role cards in size and style
- [ ] Consistent icon usage (lucide-react icons)
- [ ] Proper text truncation with ellipsis
- [ ] Action buttons aligned consistently
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints work correctly

## Implementation Guidance

### PersonalitiesList Structure

```tsx
export const PersonalitiesList = ({
  personalities,
  onEdit,
  onDelete,
  onCreateClick,
}) => {
  if (personalities.length === 0) {
    return <EmptyState onCreateClick={onCreateClick} />;
  }

  return (
    <div className="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
      {personalities.map((personality) => (
        <PersonalityCard
          key={personality.id}
          personality={personality}
          onEdit={onEdit}
          onDelete={onDelete}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### PersonalityCard Structure

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>{personality.name}</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>
      {behaviorCount} behaviors â€¢ {customInstructionsPreview}
    </CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>{/* Big Five traits summary */}</CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <Button variant="outline" size="sm" onClick={handleEdit}>
      <Pencil className="h-4 w-4" />
      Edit
    </Button>
    <Button variant="outline" size="sm" onClick={handleDelete}>
      <Trash className="h-4 w-4" />
      Delete
    </Button>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

## Testing Requirements

- List renders correct number of cards
- Empty state shows when no personalities
- Edit/Delete buttons trigger callbacks
- Cards display all personality data
- Responsive layout adjusts properly
- Text truncation works correctly

## Dependencies

- **F-remove-tab-navigation-and**: Requires restructured PersonalitiesSection to integrate into
