  - Successfully removed all tab components and cleaned up the

    CreatePersonalityForm component imports and usage, eliminated all TODO
    handler functions (handleEditPersonality, handleClonePersonality,
    handleSavePersonality, handleCancelEditing), and simplified the JSX
    structure to a clean foundation with title, description, and placeholder
    content area. The component now has minimal imports (only React) and matches
    the specified structure exactly. All quality checks pass with no TypeScript
    compilation errors or lint issues.

# Remove Tab Components and Cleanup Imports

## Context

The PersonalitiesSection currently uses tab-based navigation with SavedPersonalitiesTab and CreatePersonalityForm components. This task removes all tab-related components and cleans up the component structure to prepare for the unified single-screen layout.

**File Location**: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/PersonalitiesSection.tsx`

**Reference Pattern**: Follow the RolesSection structure at `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/roles/RolesSection.tsx`

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### Remove Tab Components

- Remove `SavedPersonalitiesTab` component usage from JSX
- Remove `CreatePersonalityForm` component usage from JSX
- Remove any div containers that separate saved/create sections
- Remove border-t and pt-8 styling from create section

### Clean Up Imports

- Remove import for `SavedPersonalitiesTab` component
- Remove import for `CreatePersonalityForm` component
- Remove any unused imports after component removal
- Keep logger import for continued use

### Simplify Component Structure

- Remove all TODO handler functions (`handleEditPersonality`, `handleClonePersonality`, `handleSavePersonality`, `handleCancelEditing`)
- Remove the space-y-8 div that contained both tab sections
- Keep the outer container with title and description
- Prepare clean slate for new layout structure

### Update JSX Structure

```tsx
return (
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <div>
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Personalities</h1>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
        Manage agent personalities and their characteristics.
      </p>
    </div>

    {/* Content area will be added in next task */}
    <div className="text-center py-8 text-muted-foreground">
      Content area placeholder - will be implemented in next feature
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Code Cleanup

- [ ] SavedPersonalitiesTab component completely removed from JSX
- [ ] CreatePersonalityForm component completely removed from JSX
- [ ] All imports for removed components deleted
- [ ] All TODO handler functions removed
- [ ] Border and spacing divs between sections removed
- [ ] No unused imports remain in file

### Structure Simplification

- [ ] Component has clean, minimal structure
- [ ] Title and description section preserved
- [ ] Placeholder content area added for next task
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] No console warnings about unused variables

### Visual Validation

- [ ] Component renders with title and description
- [ ] Placeholder text displays in content area
- [ ] No broken imports or missing components
- [ ] Layout matches outer container of RolesSection

## Implementation Guidance

1. **Start with imports**: Remove the SavedPersonalitiesTab and CreatePersonalityForm imports first
2. **Remove handlers**: Delete all the useCallback functions that are no longer needed
3. **Simplify JSX**: Replace the complex tab structure with simple container and placeholder
4. **Test compilation**: Ensure TypeScript compiles without errors
5. **Visual check**: Verify component renders correctly with clean structure

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing

- Component renders without errors
- Title and description display correctly
- Placeholder text shows in content area
- No console errors or warnings
- TypeScript compilation passes

### Unit Test Updates

- Update existing tests to match new simplified structure
- Test component renders with title and description
- Test placeholder content area displays
- Remove tests for deleted handler functions

## Security Considerations

- No security implications for this cleanup task
- Removing unused code reduces attack surface

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundational cleanup task

## Estimated Time

1-1.5 hours including testing and validation
