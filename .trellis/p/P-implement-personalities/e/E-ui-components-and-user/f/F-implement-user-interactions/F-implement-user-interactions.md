# Implement User Interactions and Dialogs

## Purpose and Goals

Implement all user interaction flows including the modal system for create/edit forms, delete confirmation dialogs, loading states, and error handling. This feature brings together the components created in previous features with proper user interaction patterns matching the Roles section.

## Key Components to Implement

### Modal System

- Form modal for create/edit personality
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Modal backdrop and animations
- Keyboard navigation support (ESC to close)
- Focus management

### Interaction Handlers

- Create button opens form modal in create mode
- Edit button opens form modal with pre-populated data
- Delete button shows confirmation dialog
- Form submission triggers store actions
- Success/error feedback to users

### Loading States

- Show spinner during save operations
- Disable buttons during async operations
- Prevent duplicate submissions
- Loading overlay on cards during delete

### Error Handling

- Display store errors in toast/alert
- Form validation errors inline
- Network error recovery options
- Graceful degradation

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Modal Behavior

- [ ] Create button opens modal with empty form
- [ ] Edit button opens modal with populated form
- [ ] ESC key closes modals
- [ ] Clicking backdrop closes modals
- [ ] Modals prevent background scrolling
- [ ] Focus trapped within modal
- [ ] Animation on open/close

### Delete Confirmation

- [ ] Delete button shows confirmation dialog
- [ ] Dialog explains consequences clearly
- [ ] Shows personality name being deleted
- [ ] Confirm button executes deletion
- [ ] Cancel button closes dialog
- [ ] Loading state during deletion
- [ ] Success feedback after deletion

### Form Modal Integration

- [ ] Modal title changes based on mode
- [ ] Form renders inside Dialog component
- [ ] Save button disabled during submission
- [ ] Modal closes on successful save
- [ ] Errors keep modal open
- [ ] Cancel button closes without saving
- [ ] Unsaved changes warning (optional)

### Loading States

- [ ] Spinner/skeleton during initial load
- [ ] Button loading states with spinner
- [ ] Disabled state during operations
- [ ] Card overlay during deletion
- [ ] Form fields disabled during save
- [ ] Proper loading text ("Creating...", "Updating...", "Deleting...")

### Error Display

- [ ] Toast notifications for operations
- [ ] Inline form validation errors
- [ ] Network error messages
- [ ] Retry button for failed operations
- [ ] Clear error dismissal
- [ ] Error boundary for crashes

## Implementation Guidance

### Modal Structure Pattern

```tsx
<Dialog open={formModalOpen} onOpenChange={setFormModalOpen}>
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogHeader>
      <DialogTitle>
        {formMode === "create" ? "Create Personality" : "Edit Personality"}
      </DialogTitle>
    </DialogHeader>
    <PersonalityForm
      mode={formMode}
      personality={selectedPersonality}
      onSave={handleSavePersonality}
      onCancel={() => setFormModalOpen(false)}
      isSaving={isSaving}
    />
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

### Delete Confirmation Pattern

```tsx
<AlertDialog open={deleteDialogOpen} onOpenChange={setDeleteDialogOpen}>
  <AlertDialogContent>
    <AlertDialogHeader>
      <AlertDialogTitle>Delete Personality</AlertDialogTitle>
      <AlertDialogDescription>
        Are you sure you want to delete "{selectedPersonality?.name}"? This
        action cannot be undone.
      </AlertDialogDescription>
    </AlertDialogHeader>
    <AlertDialogFooter>
      <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
      <AlertDialogAction onClick={handleConfirmDelete} disabled={isDeleting}>
        {isDeleting ? "Deleting..." : "Delete"}
      </AlertDialogAction>
    </AlertDialogFooter>
  </AlertDialogContent>
</AlertDialog>
```

### Handler Implementations

```tsx
const handleCreatePersonality = () => {
  setFormMode("create");
  setSelectedPersonality(undefined);
  setFormModalOpen(true);
};

const handleEditPersonality = (personality: PersonalityViewModel) => {
  setFormMode("edit");
  setSelectedPersonality(personality);
  setFormModalOpen(true);
};

const handleSavePersonality = async (data: PersonalityFormData) => {
  try {
    if (formMode === "create") {
      await createPersonality(data);
    } else {
      await updatePersonality(selectedPersonality.id, data);
    }
    setFormModalOpen(false);
    toast.success(
      `Personality ${formMode === "create" ? "created" : "updated"}`,
    );
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error(error.message);
  }
};
```

## Testing Requirements

- All buttons trigger correct actions
- Modals open and close properly
- Form submissions work in both modes
- Delete confirmation prevents accidents
- Loading states prevent race conditions
- Errors display appropriately
- Keyboard navigation works

## Security Considerations

- Prevent double-submission attacks
- Validate data before store operations
- Sanitize displayed personality names
- Handle rapid clicks gracefully

## Dependencies

- **F-create-list-components**: Requires list components for integration
- **F-refactor-unified-personalityfo**: Requires refactored form component
