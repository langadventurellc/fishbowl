# Implement Loading States and Button Management

## Context

Add comprehensive loading state management to prevent race conditions, duplicate submissions, and provide visual feedback during async operations. This includes button states, loading overlays, and proper loading text as specified in the feature requirements.

## Implementation Requirements

### Loading State Sources

- Use personalities store loading states for async operations
- Track local loading states for specific operations when needed
- Disable form submissions during save operations
- Show loading overlays on cards during deletion
- Display appropriate loading text ("Creating...", "Updating...", "Deleting...")

### Button State Management

- Disable save button during form submission
- Disable delete buttons during deletion operations
- Show spinner icons during loading
- Change button text to indicate current operation
- Prevent rapid clicking and duplicate submissions

### Visual Loading Indicators

- Form save button: disabled state + spinner + "Creating..."/"Updating..." text
- Delete button in dialog: disabled state + "Deleting..." text
- Card overlay during deletion (optional enhancement)
- Form fields disabled during save (optional enhancement)

## Technical Approach

1. **Form Modal Loading States**

   ```tsx
   // In PersonalityFormModal and PersonalityForm
   <Button type="submit" disabled={isSaving || isSubmitting} className="w-full">
     {isSaving ? (
       <>
         <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
         {mode === "create" ? "Creating..." : "Updating..."}
       </>
     ) : mode === "create" ? (
       "Create Personality"
     ) : (
       "Update Personality"
     )}
   </Button>
   ```

2. **Delete Dialog Loading States**

   ```tsx
   // In DeletePersonalityDialog
   <AlertDialogAction onClick={handleConfirmDelete} disabled={isDeleting}>
     {isDeleting ? (
       <>
         <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
         Deleting...
       </>
     ) : (
       "Delete"
     )}
   </AlertDialogAction>
   ```

3. **Store Integration**
   - Use store `isLoading` state for overall operations
   - Track specific operation states if store doesn't provide granular states
   - Integrate with store error states for proper error handling

4. **Card Loading States** (optional enhancement)
   - Add overlay div during deletion
   - Fade out card or show deletion in progress

## Acceptance Criteria

### Form Loading States

- [ ] Save button disabled during form submission
- [ ] Save button shows spinner icon during loading
- [ ] Save button text changes to "Creating..." or "Updating..."
- [ ] Form submission prevented during loading
- [ ] Form fields optionally disabled during save
- [ ] Loading state clears on success or error

### Delete Loading States

- [ ] Delete button in dialog disabled during deletion
- [ ] Delete button shows "Deleting..." text during operation
- [ ] Delete button shows spinner icon during loading
- [ ] Deletion operation cannot be triggered multiple times
- [ ] Loading state clears after deletion completes

### Button Interaction Prevention

- [ ] Multiple rapid clicks prevented on save button
- [ ] Multiple rapid clicks prevented on delete button
- [ ] Form submission prevented while loading
- [ ] All async operations show appropriate feedback

### Visual Consistency

- [ ] Loading spinners use consistent icon (Loader2)
- [ ] Loading text follows pattern: "[Action]ing..."
- [ ] Disabled states use consistent styling
- [ ] Loading states match existing app patterns

## Testing Requirements

- Test button disabled states during operations
- Test loading text changes appropriately
- Test spinner icons appear and animate
- Test prevention of duplicate submissions
- Test loading state cleanup on success/error
- Test rapid clicking scenarios
- Test keyboard accessibility during loading

## Dependencies

- Loader2 icon from lucide-react
- Button component from shadcn/ui
- personalities store loading states
- React state management for local loading tracking

## Files to Modify

- Update: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/personalities/PersonalityFormModal.tsx`
- Update: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/personalities/DeletePersonalityDialog.tsx`
- Update: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/personalities/PersonalityForm.tsx` (if needed)
- Update: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/personalities/PersonalityCard.tsx` (if adding card overlays)
- Add unit tests for loading state behavior
