  apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/PersonalityForm.tsx:
    Updated button loading logic to use isLoading prop instead of isSubmitting
    for loading state display, and changed loading text to 'Creating...' or
    'Updating...' to match roles pattern
log:
  - Successfully implemented loading states following the roles pattern. After
    analysis, found that PersonalityFormModal and DeletePersonalityDialog
    already correctly followed the pattern with isLoading props and proper
    loading text/icons. The only issue was in PersonalityForm component which
    was using isSubmitting for button loading display instead of isLoading.
    Fixed the PersonalityForm to use isLoading prop for button loading states
    and changed text to "Creating..." or "Updating..." to match the exact roles
    pattern. All quality checks and tests pass.

# Implement Loading States Following Roles Pattern

## Context

Add comprehensive loading state management following the exact patterns established in the roles section. This ensures consistency in loading behavior and prevents race conditions across the application.

## Implementation Requirements

### Loading State Sources

- Use personalities store loading states for async operations following roles pattern
- Use `isSaving` and `isLoading` states from store (matching roles)
- Disable form submissions during save operations
- Show loading overlays on cards during deletion
- Display appropriate loading text ("Creating...", "Updating...", "Deleting...")

### Button State Management Following Roles Pattern

- Disable save button during form submission using `isLoading` prop
- Disable delete buttons during deletion operations using `isLoading` prop
- Show spinner icons during loading (Loader2 from lucide-react)
- Change button text to indicate current operation
- Prevent rapid clicking and duplicate submissions

### Visual Loading Indicators Following Roles Pattern

**Form Save Button (match RoleFormModal pattern):**

```tsx
<Button type="submit" disabled={isLoading || isSubmitting} className="w-full">
  {isLoading ? (
    <>
      <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
      {mode === "create" ? "Creating..." : "Updating..."}
    </>
  ) : mode === "create" ? (
    "Create Personality"
  ) : (
    "Update Personality"
  )}
</Button>
```

**Delete Button in Dialog (match RoleDeleteDialog pattern):**

```tsx
<AlertDialogAction onClick={handleConfirmDelete} disabled={isLoading}>
  {isLoading ? (
    <>
      <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
      Deleting...
    </>
  ) : (
    "Delete"
  )}
</AlertDialogAction>
```

## Technical Approach

1. **PersonalityFormModal Loading States**
   - Use `isLoading` prop (not `isSaving`) to match roles pattern
   - Pass loading state to PersonalityForm component
   - Ensure save button shows correct loading state

2. **DeletePersonalityDialog Loading States**
   - Use `isLoading` prop (not `isDeleting`) to match roles pattern
   - Show spinner and "Deleting..." text during operation
   - Disable button during deletion

3. **Store Integration**
   - Use store `isSaving` state for operations
   - Pass as `isLoading` prop to components
   - Integrate with store error states for proper error handling

4. **Card Loading States** (optional enhancement)
   - Add overlay div during deletion if needed
   - Follow roles section implementation

## Prop Name Corrections

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure all prop names match the roles pattern:

- ✅ Use `isLoading` (not `isSaving` or `isDeleting`)
- ✅ Use `isOpen` (not `open`)
- ✅ Follow exact prop interface from roles components

## Acceptance Criteria

### Form Loading States

- [ ] Save button disabled during form submission using `isLoading` prop
- [ ] Save button shows spinner icon during loading (Loader2)
- [ ] Save button text changes to "Creating..." or "Updating..."
- [ ] Form submission prevented during loading
- [ ] Loading state clears on success or error
- [ ] Props match PersonalityFormModal interface exactly

### Delete Loading States

- [ ] Delete button in dialog disabled during deletion using `isLoading` prop
- [ ] Delete button shows "Deleting..." text during operation
- [ ] Delete button shows spinner icon during loading (Loader2)
- [ ] Deletion operation cannot be triggered multiple times
- [ ] Loading state clears after deletion completes
- [ ] Props match corrected DeletePersonalityDialog interface

### Button Interaction Prevention

- [ ] Multiple rapid clicks prevented on save button
- [ ] Multiple rapid clicks prevented on delete button
- [ ] Form submission prevented while loading
- [ ] All async operations show appropriate feedback

### Visual Consistency

- [ ] Loading spinners use Loader2 icon (consistent with roles)
- [ ] Loading text follows pattern: "[Action]ing..."
- [ ] Disabled states use consistent styling
- [ ] Loading states match roles section patterns exactly

## Testing Requirements

- Test button disabled states during operations
- Test loading text changes appropriately
- Test spinner icons appear and animate
- Test prevention of duplicate submissions
- Test loading state cleanup on success/error
- Test rapid clicking scenarios
- Test keyboard accessibility during loading

## Dependencies

- Loader2 icon from lucide-react
- Button component from shadcn/ui
- personalities store loading states (isSaving, isLoading)
- React state management for local loading tracking

## Files to Modify

- Update: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/PersonalityFormModal.tsx` (verify loading states)
- Update: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/DeletePersonalityDialog.tsx` (fix prop names)
- Update: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/PersonalityForm.tsx` (if needed)
- Update: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/PersonalitiesSection.tsx` (ensure correct props passed)
- Add unit tests for loading state behavior

## Prerequisites

- DeletePersonalityDialog props must be corrected first (T-create-deletepersonalitydialog)
- PersonalityFormModal already follows correct pattern

## Priority

**MEDIUM** - Important for user experience and preventing race conditions
