# React Personalities Context Provider

## Purpose and Functionality

Create the `PersonalitiesProvider` React component that initializes the personalities store with the desktop adapter on application startup. This provider ensures personalities data is loaded and available throughout the application, handling initialization errors gracefully with appropriate loading states.

## Key Components to Implement

- `PersonalitiesProvider` React component with proper lifecycle management
- Store initialization with desktop adapter dependency injection
- Loading state management during initial data loading
- Error handling and recovery for initialization failures
- Integration with existing app component structure

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Behavior

- **Store Initialization**: Provider calls `usePersonalitiesStore.initialize()` with desktop adapter on mount
- **Loading State Management**: Shows loading spinner while initialization is in progress
- **Data Loading**: Automatically loads initial personalities data from file during initialization
- **Error Recovery**: Handles initialization errors gracefully with retry mechanisms
- **Children Rendering**: Only renders children components after successful initialization

### Component Lifecycle Requirements

- Initialization occurs only once on component mount using `useEffect`
- Loading state properly managed with boolean flag
- Cleanup handled appropriately on component unmount
- No memory leaks from unhandled promises or event listeners

### Error Handling and User Experience

- Initialization errors displayed with user-friendly messages
- Retry button available for failed initialization attempts
- Graceful fallback to default personalities if file loading fails
- Loading spinner with appropriate messaging during initialization

### Integration Requirements

- Seamless integration with existing app component hierarchy
- Compatible with React 19+ and strict mode
- Works with existing error boundary components
- Follows established context provider patterns from roles implementation

### Performance Requirements

- Initialization completes within 2 seconds for typical datasets
- No blocking of UI rendering during background loading
- Efficient re-render prevention when initialization state doesn't change
- Memory efficient with proper cleanup of initialization resources

## Implementation Guidance

### Technical Approach

```typescript
export const PersonalitiesProvider: React.FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [isInitializing, setIsInitializing] = useState(true);
  const [initError, setInitError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const { initialize } = usePersonalitiesStore();

  const handleInitialize = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      setInitError(null);
      await initialize(desktopPersonalitiesAdapter);
      logger.info("Personalities store initialized successfully");
    } catch (error) {
      const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown initialization error";
      setInitError(errorMessage);
      logger.error("Failed to initialize personalities store", { error: errorMessage });
    } finally {
      setIsInitializing(false);
    }
  }, [initialize]);

  useEffect(() => {
    handleInitialize();
  }, [handleInitialize]);

  if (isInitializing) {
    return (
      <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
        <LoadingSpinner />
        <span className="ml-2">Loading personalities...</span>
      </div>
    );
  }

  if (initError) {
    return (
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
        <div className="text-red-600 mb-4">Failed to load personalities: {initError}</div>
        <Button onClick={handleInitialize}>Retry</Button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
};
```

### Context Integration

- Create context if additional state sharing is needed beyond the store
- Provide adapter instance through context for direct access if required
- Follow established patterns from roles provider implementation
- Use proper TypeScript typing for context values

### Error Boundaries

- Work with existing error boundary components
- Provide fallback UI for catastrophic initialization failures
- Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring
- Allow graceful recovery without full app restart

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests (Required)

- Test successful initialization flow with store setup
- Test loading state management during initialization
- Test error handling for initialization failures
- Test retry functionality after failed initialization
- Test children rendering only after successful initialization
- Test proper cleanup on component unmount

### Component Integration Tests (Required)

- Test provider integration with personalities store
- Test adapter injection and store initialization
- Test error propagation from store to component
- Verify no memory leaks during mount/unmount cycles

### Test Coverage Requirements

- 100% code coverage for provider component
- All error scenarios tested with mocked store failures
- Loading state transitions properly tested
- Mock desktop adapter for isolated testing

**IMPORTANT**: Do not create integration or performance tests for this feature.

## Security Considerations

### Error Information Security

- Sanitize error messages displayed to users
- No sensitive file paths or system information in UI error messages
- Log detailed errors securely for debugging without exposing to UI
- Prevent error messages from revealing internal application structure

### State Management Security

- Ensure no sensitive data persisted in component state
- Proper cleanup of any temporary data during initialization
- No caching of authentication or personal data in provider

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Requires desktop personalities adapter implementation
- **Store Integration**: Depends on `usePersonalitiesStore` from ui-shared package
- **UI Components**: Requires loading spinner and button components
- **Error Handling**: Integrates with existing error boundary system

## Implementation Notes

### File Structure

- Create `apps/desktop/src/contexts/PersonalitiesProvider.tsx`
- Export provider component and any related types
- Follow naming conventions from existing context providers

### App Integration

- Integrate into main app component hierarchy at appropriate level
- Ensure proper ordering with other context providers
- Consider placement relative to error boundaries and routing

### Development Considerations

- Use React DevTools for debugging initialization flow
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all props and state
- Follow React best practices for context providers and lifecycle management
- Use consistent styling with existing loading states and error messages
