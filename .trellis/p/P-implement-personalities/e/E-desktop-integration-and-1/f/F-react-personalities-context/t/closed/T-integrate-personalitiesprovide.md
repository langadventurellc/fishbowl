log:
  - Successfully integrated PersonalitiesProvider into the main desktop app
    component hierarchy. Added PersonalitiesProvider to contexts/index.ts
    exports and positioned it inside RolesProvider in App.tsx, following the
    established provider integration pattern. Updated App.test.tsx to include
    PersonalitiesProvider mocks. The provider now initializes during app startup
    and provides personalities context to all child components. All quality
    checks (lint, format, type-check) and tests are passing.

# Integrate PersonalitiesProvider into App Hierarchy

## Purpose

Integrate the newly created `PersonalitiesProvider` component into the main app component hierarchy, ensuring proper ordering with other context providers and following established integration patterns.

## Implementation Requirements

### Location Analysis

- Find the main app component where providers are integrated
- Likely locations: `apps/desktop/src/App.tsx`, `apps/desktop/src/main.tsx`, or similar entry point
- Examine how `RolesProvider` is currently integrated to follow the same pattern

### Provider Integration Steps

1. **Import PersonalitiesProvider**

   ```typescript
   import { PersonalitiesProvider } from "./contexts/PersonalitiesProvider";
   ```

2. **Add to Provider Hierarchy**
   - Place PersonalitiesProvider in the same level as RolesProvider
   - Ensure proper nesting order (typically providers wrap other providers or children)
   - Follow the existing provider nesting pattern

3. **Example Integration Pattern**
   ```jsx
   <ServicesProvider>
     <SettingsProvider>
       <RolesProvider>
         <PersonalitiesProvider>{/* App components */}</PersonalitiesProvider>
       </RolesProvider>
     </SettingsProvider>
   </ServicesProvider>
   ```

### Integration Verification

- Ensure no circular dependencies are created
- Verify PersonalitiesProvider is accessible to components that need it
- Check that initialization order is correct (PersonalitiesProvider should initialize after required dependencies)
- Confirm error boundaries properly handle PersonalitiesProvider errors

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [x] PersonalitiesProvider is properly imported and integrated into app hierarchy
- [x] Provider initialization occurs at appropriate point in app startup
- [x] PersonalitiesProvider follows the same integration pattern as RolesProvider
- [x] App starts successfully with PersonalitiesProvider in the hierarchy
- [x] No initialization order issues or dependency conflicts

### Code Quality Requirements

- [x] Clean import structure with no unused imports
- [x] Consistent code formatting and style
- [x] No TypeScript errors or warnings
- [x] Proper component nesting and readability

### Integration Testing Requirements

- [x] Verify app starts without errors
- [x] Check that personality context is available to child components
- [x] Ensure loading states display properly during app initialization
- [x] Confirm error handling works if PersonalitiesProvider fails

## Implementation Notes

### Research Required

1. Find where RolesProvider is currently integrated
2. Identify the main app entry point and provider hierarchy
3. Check for any special considerations around provider ordering

### Files to Examine

- `apps/desktop/src/App.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/main.tsx`
- Look for existing provider integration patterns
- Check how other context providers are structured

### Potential Integration Points

- Main App component render method
- Provider composition component if one exists
- Root component where other providers are wrapped

## Dependencies

- Requires completion of PersonalitiesProvider component creation
- Depends on existing app architecture and provider patterns

## Testing Verification

After integration, verify:

1. App starts successfully
2. No console errors during initialization
3. PersonalitiesProvider loading state appears briefly
4. Personalities data becomes available after initialization
