# Integrate personalities handlers with main process initialization

## Context and Purpose

Integrate the personalities IPC handlers and repository manager with the main process initialization, following the exact patterns used for roles integration. This ensures personalities handlers are properly initialized when the Electron app starts.

## Implementation Requirements

### Integration Points

**1. Main Process Services Integration**

- File: `apps/desktop/src/main/services/MainProcessServices.ts`
- Add personalities repository manager initialization
- Follow the exact pattern used for roles repository manager

**2. Handler Registration**

- File: `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts` (or equivalent main process entry)
- Add call to `setupPersonalitiesHandlers()`
- Register handlers at the same time as other IPC handlers
- Follow the exact pattern used for `setupRolesHandlers()`

### Code Changes Required

**MainProcessServices.ts:**

```typescript
// Add import
import { personalitiesRepositoryManager } from "../data/repositories/personalitiesRepositoryManager";

// In constructor, add after roles initialization:
personalitiesRepositoryManager.initialize(userDataPath);
```

**Main process entry file:**

```typescript
// Add import
import { setupPersonalitiesHandlers } from "./personalitiesHandlers";

// Add handler setup call (typically in app ready handler):
setupPersonalitiesHandlers();
```

### Integration Requirements

- Initialize personalities repository manager with same user data path as roles
- Call `setupPersonalitiesHandlers()` in the same location as `setupRolesHandlers()`
- Ensure proper initialization order (repository before handlers)
- Follow exact same error handling patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing IPC handler registration

### Error Handling

- Handle initialization failures gracefully
- Log initialization success/failure appropriately
- Ensure app can start even if personalities initialization fails
- Follow same error handling patterns as roles integration

## Testing Requirements

**Integration Testing:**

- Verify repository manager is initialized with correct user data path
- Verify handlers are registered during app startup
- Test that personalities IPC calls work end-to-end after initialization
- Ensure initialization order is correct

**Unit Testing:**

- Test MainProcessServices initialization includes personalities
- Mock dependencies to test integration points
- Verify error handling during initialization

## Dependencies

- `setupPersonalitiesHandlers` function (from previous task)
- `personalitiesRepositoryManager` (from previous task)
- Existing main process initialization code
- User data path configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PersonalitiesRepositoryManager initialized in MainProcessServices
- [ ] setupPersonalitiesHandlers called in main process startup
- [ ] Integration follows exact same patterns as roles integration
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging implemented
- [ ] Initialization order correct (repository before handlers)
- [ ] End-to-end IPC communication working after integration
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing initialization flow

**File References:**

- Pattern: `apps/desktop/src/main/services/MainProcessServices.ts` (roles integration)
- Pattern: Main process entry file where `setupRolesHandlers()` is called
- IPC Setup: `apps/desktop/src/electron/rolesHandlers.ts:83` (handler registration pattern)
