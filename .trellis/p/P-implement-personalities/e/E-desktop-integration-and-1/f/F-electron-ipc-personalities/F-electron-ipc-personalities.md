# Electron IPC Personalities Integration

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement the Electron main process IPC handlers for personalities file operations, integrating with the existing FileStorageService. This feature provides the secure server-side implementation that the desktop adapter communicates with through IPC channels.

## Key Components to Implement

- IPC channel handlers for personalities operations in main process
- Integration with existing `FileStorageService` for file I/O
- Input validation and sanitization for all IPC calls
- Error handling and logging for main process operations
- Security validation to prevent unauthorized file access

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Behavior

- **Save Handler**: `personalities:save` IPC handler validates input and saves data using FileStorageService
- **Load Handler**: `personalities:load` IPC handler loads data from file or returns null if missing
- **Reset Handler**: `personalities:reset` IPC handler creates backup and restores default personalities
- **Channel Registration**: All handlers properly registered with `ipcMain.handle()` during app initialization

### Data Validation and Security

- All input data validated against personalities schema before file operations
- File paths sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Input size limits enforced to prevent resource exhaustion
- Return data properly structured and validated before sending to renderer

### File Operations Integration

- Seamless integration with existing `FileStorageService` class
- Proper file locking and atomic operations for save operations
- Error handling for file permission issues and disk space problems
- Backup creation before destructive operations (reset)

### Error Handling and Logging

- Comprehensive error logging in main process without exposing sensitive data
- User-friendly error messages sent back to renderer process
- Graceful handling of file corruption scenarios
- Recovery strategies for common file operation failures

### Performance Requirements

- Save operations complete within 500ms for typical personality datasets
- Load operations complete within 200ms
- Concurrent operation handling without blocking other IPC calls
- Efficient memory usage during large file operations

## Implementation Guidance

### Technical Approach

```typescript
// In main process setup
ipcMain.handle(
  "personalities:save",
  async (event, data: PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData) => {
    try {
      // Validate input against schema
      const validatedData = personalitiesSettingsSchema.parse(data);

      // Save using FileStorageService
      await fileStorageService.savePersonalities(validatedData);

      logger.info("Personalities saved successfully");
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error("Failed to save personalities", { error: error.message });
      throw new Error(`Save operation failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
  },
);

ipcMain.handle("personalities:load", async () => {
  try {
    const data = await fileStorageService.loadPersonalities();
    return data || null;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === "ENOENT") {
      return null; // File doesn't exist yet
    }
    logger.error("Failed to load personalities", { error: error.message });
    throw new Error(`Load operation failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
});

ipcMain.handle("personalities:reset", async () => {
  try {
    // Create backup before reset
    await fileStorageService.backupPersonalities();

    // Load and save default personalities
    const defaults = createDefaultPersonalitiesSettings();
    await fileStorageService.savePersonalities(defaults);

    logger.info("Personalities reset to defaults");
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error("Failed to reset personalities", { error: error.message });
    throw new Error(`Reset operation failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
});
```

### File Integration Points

- Add personalities methods to existing `FileStorageService` class
- Follow established patterns from roles file operations
- Use same file naming conventions and directory structure
- Integrate with existing backup and recovery mechanisms

### Security Implementation

- Validate all input using Zod schemas before processing
- Log security-relevant events for audit trail
- Implement rate limiting for IPC calls if needed
- Ensure no path traversal vulnerabilities in file operations

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests (Required)

- Test successful save operation with valid personalities data
- Test successful load operation returning correct data structure
- Test successful reset operation with backup creation
- Test input validation rejection of malformed data
- Test error handling for file permission failures
- Test error handling for disk space issues
- Test concurrent operation handling

### Security Tests (Required)

- Test input validation prevents malicious data injection
- Test file path sanitization prevents directory traversal
- Test rate limiting prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- Verify no sensitive information in error messages sent to renderer

### Test Coverage Requirements

- 100% code coverage for all IPC handlers
- All error conditions tested with simulated failures
- Mock FileStorageService for isolated testing

**IMPORTANT**: Do not create integration or performance tests for this feature.

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation

- All IPC input validated with Zod schemas before processing
- Size limits enforced on personalities data to prevent memory exhaustion
- String length limits enforced on all text fields
- No execution of user-provided code or file paths

### File System Security

- All file operations restricted to user data directory
- No symbolic link following to prevent unauthorized access
- Atomic file operations to prevent corruption during concurrent access
- Backup operations to enable recovery from corruption

### Error Information Security

- Error messages sanitized to prevent information disclosure
- No file system paths exposed in error messages sent to renderer
- Audit logging of all file operations for security monitoring

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Requires `FileStorageService` integration and personalities schemas from persistence layer
- **Integration Points**: Works with desktop adapter IPC calls
- **File System**: Requires user data directory access and file permission handling

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing IPC naming conventions used by other features
- Integrate cleanly with existing main process initialization code
- Use consistent error handling patterns from other IPC handlers
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing file storage structure
- Consider future extensibility for additional personalities operations
