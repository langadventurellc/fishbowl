  - Created DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter class structure with proper TypeScript
    interface implementation. The adapter follows the exact pattern from
    DesktopRolesAdapter with comprehensive JSDoc documentation and stub methods
    that throw "Method not implemented" as specified. All imports are correctly
    configured and the class is ready for subsequent implementation tasks.

# Create DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter Class Structure and Setup

## Context and Purpose

Create the foundational structure for the `DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter` class that implements the `PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter` interface. This task establishes the file structure, imports, and class declaration following the proven pattern from the existing `DesktopRolesAdapter` implementation.

## Detailed Requirements

### File Creation and Structure

- Create `apps/desktop/src/adapters/desktopPersonalitiesAdapter.ts`
- Follow exact file naming and location pattern from existing adapters
- Set up proper TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- Include comprehensive JSDoc documentation for the class

### Import Configuration

- Import `PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter` interface from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
- Import `PersonalitiesPersistenceError` from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
- Import `PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData` type from `@fishbowl-ai/shared`
- Follow exact import structure from `DesktopRolesAdapter` pattern

### Class Declaration

- Create `DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter` class implementing `PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter`
- Add proper TypeScript interface implementation
- Include class-level JSDoc documentation explaining purpose and usage
- Create stub methods for `save()`, `load()`, and `reset()` with proper signatures

## Implementation Guidance

### Code Structure Template

```typescript
import {
  PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter,
  PersonalitiesPersistenceError,
} from "@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared";
import type { PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData } from "@fishbowl-ai/shared";

/**
 * Desktop implementation of PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter that uses Electron IPC
 * to communicate with the main process for file operations.
 *
 * This adapter provides secure file operations by delegating all I/O to the main
 * process through established IPC channels, following Electron security best practices.
 */
export class DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter
  implements PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter
{
  // Method stubs to be implemented in subsequent tasks
  async save(personalities: PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData): Promise<void> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented");
  }

  async load(): Promise<PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData | null> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented");
  }

  async reset(): Promise<void> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented");
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Configuration

- Ensure strict type checking is enabled
- Verify all imports resolve correctly
- Confirm interface implementation is complete
- Use explicit return types for all methods

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### File Structure Validation

- [ ] File created at exact path: `apps/desktop/src/adapters/desktopPersonalitiesAdapter.ts`
- [ ] File follows TypeScript naming conventions and project structure
- [ ] All imports resolve without errors in IDE and build process
- [ ] File compiles successfully with TypeScript strict mode enabled

### Interface Implementation Validation

- [ ] Class correctly implements `PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter` interface
- [ ] All three required methods present with correct signatures:
  - `save(personalities: PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData): Promise<void>`
  - `load(): Promise<PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData | null>`
  - `reset(): Promise<void>`
- [ ] TypeScript compiler confirms complete interface implementation
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or warnings in the file

### Code Quality Standards

- [ ] Class includes comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- [ ] Imports are organized and follow project conventions
- [ ] Code follows existing adapter patterns from roles implementation
- [ ] Method stubs include appropriate "not implemented" errors

### Integration Readiness

- [ ] File can be imported by other modules without errors
- [ ] Class can be instantiated successfully
- [ ] Interface methods can be called (even if stubbed)
- [ ] Ready for implementation of actual method logic in subsequent tasks

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- Requires `PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter` interface from ui-shared package
- Requires `PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData` type from shared package
- Requires TypeScript build environment configured

### Referenced Patterns

- Follow implementation pattern from `apps/desktop/src/adapters/desktopRolesAdapter.ts`
- Use same error handling approach as existing adapters
- Mirror file structure and naming conventions

## Security Considerations

- All file operations will be delegated to main process through IPC
- No direct file system access from renderer process
- Follow Electron contextIsolation security requirements
- Prepare for input validation in method implementations

## Testing Requirements

This task focuses on structure setup - comprehensive unit tests will be created in a subsequent dedicated testing task. For this task:

- [ ] Verify file compiles without TypeScript errors
- [ ] Confirm class can be instantiated in a simple test
- [ ] Validate interface implementation completeness

## Implementation Notes

### Follow Established Patterns

- Use exact same structure as `DesktopRolesAdapter` for consistency
- Maintain same error handling approach across all adapters
- Follow project TypeScript configuration and linting rules

### Prepare for Future Implementation

- Stub methods should have proper signatures for easy replacement
- Class structure should accommodate error handling patterns
- Consider Electron IPC call patterns that will be implemented

This task establishes the foundation for all subsequent adapter implementation tasks and ensures consistent code structure across the desktop adapter layer.
