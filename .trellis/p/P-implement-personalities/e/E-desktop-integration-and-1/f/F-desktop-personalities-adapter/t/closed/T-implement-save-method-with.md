    comprehensive error handling and unit tests. The implementation follows the
    exact pattern established by DesktopRolesAdapter, calling
    window.electronAPI.personalities.save() via IPC. Preserves existing
    PersonalitiesPersistenceError instances and wraps generic errors with proper
    operation context. Created 20 comprehensive unit tests covering all
    success/error scenarios including IPC failures, null/undefined inputs,
    timeout handling, and performance testing. All quality checks pass (linting,

# Implement Save Method with Error Handling and Unit Tests

## Context and Purpose

Implement the `save()` method of the `DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter` class with comprehensive error handling and input validation. This method persists personalities data through Electron IPC, following the exact pattern established by the `DesktopRolesAdapter` implementation.

## Detailed Requirements

### Method Implementation

- Replace the stub `save()` method with full implementation
- Call `window.electronAPI.personalities.save(personalities)` for IPC communication
- Implement comprehensive error handling with proper error wrapping
- Follow the exact error handling pattern from `DesktopRolesAdapter.save()`

### Error Handling Implementation

- Catch all errors from the IPC call
- Preserve existing `PersonalitiesPersistenceError` instances without rewrapping
- Convert generic errors to `PersonalitiesPersistenceError` with "save" operation
- Include original error as cause for debugging purposes
- Provide user-friendly error messages

### Input Validation

- Validate that `personalities` parameter is not null/undefined
- Ensure data structure matches expected `PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData` type
- Handle edge cases like empty personalities arrays
- Consider data size limitations for IPC calls

## Implementation Guidance

### Code Pattern to Follow

```typescript
async save(personalities: PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await window.electronAPI.personalities.save(personalities);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof PersonalitiesPersistenceError) {
      throw error;
    }
    const message =
      error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Failed to save personalities";
    throw new PersonalitiesPersistenceError(message, "save", error);
  }
}
```

### Error Message Standards

- Use consistent error message format across all adapter methods
- Include operation type ("save") in error context
- Preserve technical details for debugging while keeping user messages clear
- Follow error message patterns from existing adapters

## Unit Test Implementation

### Test File Setup

- Create test file at `apps/desktop/src/adapters/__tests__/desktopPersonalitiesAdapter.test.ts`
- Follow test structure pattern from existing adapter tests
- Use Jest testing framework with proper mocking setup
- Mock `window.electronAPI.personalities` for isolated testing

### Required Test Cases

- **Successful save operation**: Test normal save flow with valid data
- **IPC call verification**: Verify correct parameters passed to IPC
- **Error preservation**: Test that `PersonalitiesPersistenceError` instances are not rewrapped
- **Generic error handling**: Test conversion of generic errors to `PersonalitiesPersistenceError`
- **Null/undefined input**: Test handling of invalid input parameters
- **IPC timeout simulation**: Test behavior when IPC calls timeout
- **Network error simulation**: Test handling of various error types

### Test Structure Example

```typescript
describe("DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter", () => {
  let adapter: DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter;
  let mockElectronAPI: jest.Mocked<typeof window.electronAPI>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup mocks
    mockElectronAPI = {
      personalities: {
        save: jest.fn(),
        load: jest.fn(),
        reset: jest.fn(),
      },
    };
    (global as any).window = { electronAPI: mockElectronAPI };

    adapter = new DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter();
  });

  describe("save", () => {
    // Test cases here
  });
});
```

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] `save()` method calls `window.electronAPI.personalities.save()` with correct parameters
- [ ] Method completes successfully when IPC call succeeds
- [ ] Method returns `Promise<void>` as specified by interface
- [ ] No data corruption or loss during save operations

### Error Handling Requirements

- [ ] Existing `PersonalitiesPersistenceError` instances passed through unchanged
- [ ] Generic errors converted to `PersonalitiesPersistenceError` with "save" operation
- [ ] Original error preserved as `cause` property for debugging
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly while preserving technical details

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Method completes within 200ms for typical personality datasets
- [ ] No memory leaks during error conditions
- [ ] Efficient parameter passing to IPC layer
- [ ] No blocking of UI thread during save operations

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] 100% code coverage for save method implementation
- [ ] All error paths tested with simulated failures
- [ ] Mock verification ensures correct IPC calls
- [ ] Edge cases covered (null input, empty data, etc.)
- [ ] Performance test ensures reasonable execution time

### Integration Requirements

- [ ] Method works with existing `usePersonalitiesStore` implementation
- [ ] Compatible with Electron's contextIsolation security model
- [ ] Follows established IPC channel naming conventions
- [ ] Consistent error handling across all adapter methods

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- Requires completed class structure from previous task
- Requires `PersonalitiesPersistenceError` class from ui-shared package
- Requires mock setup for `window.electronAPI` in tests

### Integration Points

- Depends on Electron IPC channel `personalities:save` (implemented in separate feature)
- Works with personalities store for auto-save functionality
- Integrates with file storage service through IPC layer

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation Security

- Validate data structure to prevent malformed data injection
- Ensure no sensitive data logging in error messages
- Sanitize error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Limit data size to prevent resource exhaustion attacks

### IPC Security

- Rely on Electron's contextIsolation for security boundary
- No direct file system access from renderer process
- All operations through secure IPC channels only
- Follow established security patterns from existing adapters

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Test Coverage

- Test successful save operations with various data structures
- Test error handling for all possible failure scenarios
- Verify mock interactions and parameter passing
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

### Error Simulation

- Mock IPC failures to test error handling paths
- Simulate timeout conditions and network errors
- Test behavior with malformed response data
- Verify proper error message generation

### Performance Testing

- Measure save operation completion time
- Test with large personality datasets
- Verify no memory leaks during repeated operations
- Ensure responsive UI during save operations

## Implementation Notes

### Code Quality

- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Use consistent error handling patterns
- Include comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Follow project linting and formatting standards

### Future Considerations

- Design error handling to support retry mechanisms
- Consider offline operation capabilities
- Plan for schema version migration support
- Ensure compatibility with backup and recovery systems

This task implements the core save functionality that enables personalities persistence in the desktop application, following established security and reliability patterns.
