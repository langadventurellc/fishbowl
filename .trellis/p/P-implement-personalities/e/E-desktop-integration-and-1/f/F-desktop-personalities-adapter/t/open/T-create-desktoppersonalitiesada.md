# Create DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter Class Structure and Setup

## Context and Purpose

Create the foundational structure for the `DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter` class that implements the `PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter` interface. This task establishes the file structure, imports, and class declaration following the proven pattern from the existing `DesktopRolesAdapter` implementation.

## Detailed Requirements

### File Creation and Structure

- Create `apps/desktop/src/adapters/desktopPersonalitiesAdapter.ts`
- Follow exact file naming and location pattern from existing adapters
- Set up proper TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- Include comprehensive JSDoc documentation for the class

### Import Configuration

- Import `PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter` interface from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
- Import `PersonalitiesPersistenceError` from `@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared`
- Import `PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData` type from `@fishbowl-ai/shared`
- Follow exact import structure from `DesktopRolesAdapter` pattern

### Class Declaration

- Create `DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter` class implementing `PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter`
- Add proper TypeScript interface implementation
- Include class-level JSDoc documentation explaining purpose and usage
- Create stub methods for `save()`, `load()`, and `reset()` with proper signatures

## Implementation Guidance

### Code Structure Template

```typescript
import {
  PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter,
  PersonalitiesPersistenceError,
} from "@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared";
import type { PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData } from "@fishbowl-ai/shared";

/**
 * Desktop implementation of PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter that uses Electron IPC
 * to communicate with the main process for file operations.
 *
 * This adapter provides secure file operations by delegating all I/O to the main
 * process through established IPC channels, following Electron security best practices.
 */
export class DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter
  implements PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter
{
  // Method stubs to be implemented in subsequent tasks
  async save(personalities: PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData): Promise<void> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented");
  }

  async load(): Promise<PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData | null> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented");
  }

  async reset(): Promise<void> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented");
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Configuration

- Ensure strict type checking is enabled
- Verify all imports resolve correctly
- Confirm interface implementation is complete
- Use explicit return types for all methods

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### File Structure Validation

- [ ] File created at exact path: `apps/desktop/src/adapters/desktopPersonalitiesAdapter.ts`
- [ ] File follows TypeScript naming conventions and project structure
- [ ] All imports resolve without errors in IDE and build process
- [ ] File compiles successfully with TypeScript strict mode enabled

### Interface Implementation Validation

- [ ] Class correctly implements `PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter` interface
- [ ] All three required methods present with correct signatures:
  - `save(personalities: PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData): Promise<void>`
  - `load(): Promise<PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData | null>`
  - `reset(): Promise<void>`
- [ ] TypeScript compiler confirms complete interface implementation
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or warnings in the file

### Code Quality Standards

- [ ] Class includes comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- [ ] Imports are organized and follow project conventions
- [ ] Code follows existing adapter patterns from roles implementation
- [ ] Method stubs include appropriate "not implemented" errors

### Integration Readiness

- [ ] File can be imported by other modules without errors
- [ ] Class can be instantiated successfully
- [ ] Interface methods can be called (even if stubbed)
- [ ] Ready for implementation of actual method logic in subsequent tasks

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- Requires `PersonalitiesPersistenceAdapter` interface from ui-shared package
- Requires `PersistedPersonalitiesSettingsData` type from shared package
- Requires TypeScript build environment configured

### Referenced Patterns

- Follow implementation pattern from `apps/desktop/src/adapters/desktopRolesAdapter.ts`
- Use same error handling approach as existing adapters
- Mirror file structure and naming conventions

## Security Considerations

- All file operations will be delegated to main process through IPC
- No direct file system access from renderer process
- Follow Electron contextIsolation security requirements
- Prepare for input validation in method implementations

## Testing Requirements

This task focuses on structure setup - comprehensive unit tests will be created in a subsequent dedicated testing task. For this task:

- [ ] Verify file compiles without TypeScript errors
- [ ] Confirm class can be instantiated in a simple test
- [ ] Validate interface implementation completeness

## Implementation Notes

### Follow Established Patterns

- Use exact same structure as `DesktopRolesAdapter` for consistency
- Maintain same error handling approach across all adapters
- Follow project TypeScript configuration and linting rules

### Prepare for Future Implementation

- Stub methods should have proper signatures for easy replacement
- Class structure should accommodate error handling patterns
- Consider Electron IPC call patterns that will be implemented

This task establishes the foundation for all subsequent adapter implementation tasks and ensures consistent code structure across the desktop adapter layer.
