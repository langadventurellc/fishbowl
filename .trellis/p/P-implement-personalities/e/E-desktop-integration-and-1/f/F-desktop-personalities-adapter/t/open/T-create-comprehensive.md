# Create Comprehensive Integration and Edge Case Test Suite

## Context and Purpose

Create a comprehensive test suite that covers integration scenarios, edge cases, and cross-method behavior for the complete `DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter` implementation. This task ensures robust testing beyond individual method tests, validating the adapter's behavior in complex scenarios and integration with the personalities store.

## Detailed Requirements

### Integration Test Coverage

- Test adapter integration with `usePersonalitiesStore`
- Verify complete save/load/reset workflow scenarios
- Test error propagation through the store layer
- Validate adapter state consistency across operations
- Test concurrent operation handling and race conditions

### Edge Case Testing

- Test with extremely large personality datasets
- Test with malformed personality data structures
- Test with network interruption during operations
- Test with rapid successive method calls
- Test with invalid IPC responses and timeouts

### Error Recovery Testing

- Test adapter behavior after IPC channel failures
- Test recovery from partial operation failures
- Test error state consistency across multiple operations
- Test retry mechanisms and timeout handling
- Test graceful degradation scenarios

## Implementation Guidance

### Test File Organization

```typescript
// apps/desktop/src/adapters/__tests__/desktopPersonalitiesAdapter.integration.test.ts

describe("DesktopPersonalitiesAdapter Integration Tests", () => {
  describe("Store Integration", () => {
    // Test integration with usePersonalitiesStore
  });

  describe("Workflow Scenarios", () => {
    // Test complete save/load/reset workflows
  });

  describe("Edge Cases", () => {
    // Test boundary conditions and unusual scenarios
  });

  describe("Error Recovery", () => {
    // Test error handling and recovery scenarios
  });

  describe("Performance", () => {
    // Test performance characteristics and limits
  });
});
```

### Store Integration Tests

- Test adapter initialization with store
- Test auto-save behavior through adapter
- Test error state propagation to store
- Test store retry mechanisms with adapter
- Test concurrent store operations through adapter

### Workflow Scenario Tests

```typescript
describe("Complete Workflows", () => {
  it("should handle save-load-reset cycle correctly", async () => {
    // Test complete data lifecycle
    const testData = createTestPersonalitiesData();

    // Save data
    await adapter.save(testData);
    expect(mockElectronAPI.personalities.save).toHaveBeenCalledWith(testData);

    // Load data back
    mockElectronAPI.personalities.load.mockResolvedValue(testData);
    const loaded = await adapter.load();
    expect(loaded).toEqual(testData);

    // Reset to defaults
    await adapter.reset();
    expect(mockElectronAPI.personalities.reset).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });

  it("should handle rapid successive operations", async () => {
    // Test concurrent operation handling
  });
});
```

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Integration Testing Requirements

- [ ] Adapter works correctly with `usePersonalitiesStore` initialization
- [ ] Auto-save operations through adapter function properly
- [ ] Error states propagate correctly to store and UI
- [ ] Store retry mechanisms work with adapter error handling
- [ ] Concurrent operations are handled safely without data corruption

### Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] Large personality datasets (100+ personalities) handled efficiently
- [ ] Malformed data structures are handled gracefully
- [ ] IPC timeout scenarios are handled appropriately
- [ ] Rapid successive calls don't cause race conditions
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under stress conditions

### Error Recovery Validation

- [ ] Adapter recovers gracefully from IPC channel failures
- [ ] Partial operation failures don't corrupt adapter state
- [ ] Error messages provide actionable information for recovery
- [ ] Retry mechanisms work correctly with exponential backoff
- [ ] Graceful degradation maintains basic functionality

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Save operations complete within 200ms for typical datasets
- [ ] Load operations complete within 100ms for typical datasets
- [ ] Reset operations complete within 500ms
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended operation
- [ ] No memory leaks detected in stress testing

### Data Integrity Testing

- [ ] Data roundtrip (save-load) preserves all information
- [ ] Concurrent operations maintain data consistency
- [ ] Error conditions don't corrupt stored data
- [ ] Reset operations properly clear and restore defaults
- [ ] Backup operations preserve data before destructive changes

## Test Scenarios

### Large Dataset Testing

- Test with 100+ personalities to validate performance
- Test with personalities containing large custom instructions
- Test with complex behavior configurations
- Validate memory usage with large datasets

### Concurrency Testing

- Test simultaneous save operations
- Test save operation interrupted by reset
- Test load operation during save
- Test rapid method calls without await

### Network Simulation

- Test IPC channel disconnection scenarios
- Test timeout handling for slow operations
- Test retry behavior with intermittent failures
- Test graceful degradation when IPC unavailable

### Data Corruption Simulation

- Test with malformed JSON responses from IPC
- Test with incomplete personality data structures
- Test with invalid schema versions
- Test with corrupted timestamp formats

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- Requires all three method implementations completed
- Requires basic unit test infrastructure from method tasks
- Requires mock setup for `window.electronAPI` and `usePersonalitiesStore`

### Integration Points

- Validates integration with personalities store
- Tests IPC channel behavior simulation
- Validates error handling consistency across features
- Tests backup and recovery system integration

## Security Considerations

### Data Validation Testing

- Test handling of malicious data injection attempts
- Validate error message sanitization prevents information disclosure
- Test input size limits prevent resource exhaustion
- Verify no sensitive data appears in error logs

### IPC Security Testing

- Test behavior with malformed IPC responses
- Validate contextIsolation security boundaries are maintained
- Test handling of unexpected IPC method calls
- Verify no direct file system access attempts

## Testing Strategy

### Stress Testing

- Run operations under high load conditions
- Test memory usage during extended operation periods
- Validate performance degrades gracefully under stress
- Test recovery from system resource exhaustion

### Integration Validation

- Test adapter behavior within complete application context
- Validate error handling consistency across application layers
- Test integration with UI error handling and retry mechanisms
- Verify compatibility with application lifecycle events

### Regression Testing

- Create test scenarios that prevent future regressions
- Test adapter behavior changes with dependency updates
- Validate backward compatibility with existing data
- Test migration scenarios for future schema changes

## Implementation Notes

### Test Infrastructure

- Use Jest testing framework with appropriate timeout settings
- Mock all external dependencies consistently
- Create reusable test data generators for various scenarios
- Implement proper test cleanup to prevent test interference

### Performance Monitoring

- Include performance benchmarks in test suite
- Monitor memory usage during test execution
