# NodeDatabaseBridge Implementation

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement the concrete DatabaseBridge using better-sqlite3 for the Electron desktop application. This implementation lives in the main process and provides the actual SQLite database operations while following the interface contract defined in the shared package.

## Key Components to Implement

### NodeDatabaseBridge Class

- Concrete implementation of DatabaseBridge interface
- better-sqlite3 integration and configuration
- Connection management and lifecycle
- Error handling and logging

### Database Configuration

- SQLite database file creation and location
- Connection options and pragmas
- Performance optimizations for desktop use
- File permissions and security settings

### Method Implementations

- All DatabaseBridge methods using better-sqlite3 API
- Synchronous operations with proper error handling
- Transaction management with rollback support
- Query parameter binding and result mapping

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Implementation Location

- [ ] NodeDatabaseBridge class in `apps/desktop/src/main/services/NodeDatabaseBridge.ts`
- [ ] Implements all DatabaseBridge interface methods
- [ ] No shared package dependencies on Node.js modules
- [ ] Follows existing bridge pattern in codebase

### Database Setup

- [ ] better-sqlite3 dependency installed in desktop package
- [ ] Database file created at `userData/fishbowl.db`
- [ ] Proper SQLite pragmas configured (journal_mode=WAL, synchronous=NORMAL)
- [ ] Database opens on construction, closes on app shutdown

### Method Implementation

- [ ] `query<T>()` method executes SELECT statements
- [ ] `execute()` method handles INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- [ ] `transaction()` method provides atomic operations
- [ ] `close()` method properly closes database connection

### Error Handling

- [ ] SQLite errors mapped to DatabaseError types
- [ ] Meaningful error messages with context
- [ ] Logging integration using existing logger
- [ ] Graceful handling of file system errors

### Connection Management

- [ ] Database connection established in constructor
- [ ] Connection state tracking and validation
- [ ] Automatic reconnection on transient failures
- [ ] Proper cleanup on application shutdown

## Implementation Guidance

### Database Configuration

```typescript
class NodeDatabaseBridge implements DatabaseBridge {
  private db: Database;

  constructor(databasePath: string) {
    this.db = new Database(databasePath);
    this.configurePragmas();
  }

  private configurePragmas(): void {
    this.db.pragma("journal_mode = WAL");
    this.db.pragma("synchronous = NORMAL");
    this.db.pragma("foreign_keys = ON");
  }
}
```

### Synchronous Operations

- Use better-sqlite3's synchronous API for simplicity
- Wrap in Promise.resolve() to match interface contract
- Handle exceptions and convert to appropriate error types

### Transaction Implementation

- Use better-sqlite3's transaction() method
- Provide proper rollback on errors
- Support nested transactions if needed

### File Location Strategy

- Use Electron's app.getPath('userData') for database location
- Create directory if it doesn't exist
- Handle permission errors gracefully

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Test all DatabaseBridge method implementations
- [ ] Mock file system for isolated testing
- [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery
- [ ] Verify transaction rollback behavior

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Test with actual SQLite database file
- [ ] Verify database file creation and permissions
- [ ] Test concurrent operation handling
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for target response times

### Error Scenario Tests

- [ ] Database file corruption handling
- [ ] Permission denied scenarios
- [ ] Disk space exhaustion
- [ ] Connection failure recovery

## Security Considerations

### File System Security

- Database file created with restricted permissions (600)
- Validate database file path to prevent directory traversal
- Ensure database runs only in main process

### SQL Injection Prevention

- Use better-sqlite3's prepared statements exclusively
- Validate parameter types before binding
- No dynamic SQL construction allowed

### Access Control

- Database access restricted to main process only
- No direct renderer process access
- All operations validated through IPC layer

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets

- Simple queries complete in <50ms
- Complex queries complete in <200ms
- Transaction overhead <10ms
- Connection establishment <100ms

### Resource Management

- Memory usage scales linearly with result set size
- Connection pooling not required (single connection)
- Efficient cleanup of prepared statements

### Optimization Features

- WAL mode for better concurrency
- Prepared statement caching
- Appropriate SQLite pragmas for desktop use

## Dependencies

- better-sqlite3: ^11.x
- @types/better-sqlite3 for TypeScript support
- Electron app module for userData path
- Existing logger from shared package
