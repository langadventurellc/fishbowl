# Implement optional platform methods (backup, vacuum, getSize)

## Context

Implement the optional platform-specific methods of NodeDatabaseBridge including backup(), vacuum(), and getSize(). These methods leverage desktop-specific capabilities for database maintenance and monitoring.

## Implementation Requirements

- Implement optional `backup?(path: string): Promise<void>` for database backup
- Implement optional `vacuum?(): Promise<void>` for database optimization
- Implement optional `getSize?(): Promise<number>` for database file size monitoring
- Use Node.js file system APIs and better-sqlite3 maintenance commands
- Handle platform-specific error scenarios gracefully

## Technical Approach

1. Use better-sqlite3's backup() API for database backup operations
2. Execute VACUUM command through better-sqlite3 for optimization
3. Use Node.js fs.stat() API to get database file size
4. Handle file system permissions and access errors
5. Integrate with existing logging for maintenance operations

## Method Implementation Template

```typescript
async backup(path: string): Promise<void> {
  // Validate backup path and permissions
  // Use better-sqlite3 backup API
  // Handle file system errors
}

async vacuum(): Promise<void> {
  // Execute VACUUM command
  // Handle database optimization errors
}

async getSize(): Promise<number> {
  // Get database file stats using fs.stat()
  // Return file size in bytes
}
```

## File System Integration

- Use Node.js path module for safe path handling
- Validate backup destination paths to prevent security issues
- Handle file permissions and disk space availability
- Ensure backup operations don't block other database operations

## Error Handling Requirements

- Handle file system permission errors gracefully
- Convert platform-specific errors to appropriate DatabaseError types
- Validate backup paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Log all maintenance operations for operational monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backup() method implemented using better-sqlite3 backup API
- [ ] Validates backup destination path for security
- [ ] vacuum() method executes VACUUM command successfully
- [ ] getSize() method returns database file size in bytes
- [ ] All methods handle connection state validation
- [ ] Platform-specific errors converted to DatabaseError types
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for all maintenance operations
- [ ] Methods marked as optional in interface implementation

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for successful backup to valid destination path
- [ ] Unit tests for backup path validation and security checks
- [ ] Unit tests for vacuum operation execution and error handling
- [ ] Unit tests for getSize() with various database file sizes
- [ ] Unit tests for file system permission error scenarios
- [ ] Mock Node.js fs APIs and better-sqlite3 backup for isolated testing
- [ ] Integration tests with actual file system operations

## Security Considerations

- Validate backup paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Ensure backup operations respect file system permissions
- Prevent backup to sensitive system locations
- Log all maintenance operations for security auditing

## Performance Requirements

- backup() completes appropriate to database size (no specific target)
- vacuum() operation time scales with database size and fragmentation
- getSize() completes quickly (<10ms) using file system stats
- Operations don't significantly impact concurrent database usage

## Dependencies

- T-implement-connection (connection management methods exist)
- Node.js fs module for file system operations
- Node.js path module for safe path manipulation
- better-sqlite3 backup API and VACUUM command support

## Implementation Notes

- Mark all methods as optional with ? syntax in implementation
- Consider backup operation impact on concurrent database usage
- Handle vacuum operations that may take significant time
- Follow existing error handling and logging patterns
- Include JSDoc with maintenance operation usage examples
- Consider backup file naming conventions and rotation policies
