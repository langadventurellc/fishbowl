    Successfully implemented the transaction<T> method for NodeDatabaseBridge
    with rollback support using better-sqlite3. The implementation uses manual
    BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK commands to support async callbacks while maintaining
    transaction atomicity. Key features include:


    - Full transaction lifecycle management with proper logging

    - Automatic rollback on any callback error or exception  

    - Support for nested transaction detection (executes within existing
    transaction)

    - Comprehensive error conversion to TransactionError types with context

    - Generic type preservation for callback return values

    - Connection state validation and proper cleanup

    - 13 comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios including success,
    failure, nested operations, error handling, and state management


    All tests pass (71/71) and quality checks pass with only a minor warning
    about function complexity, which is acceptable given the comprehensive error
    handling requirements.

# Implement transaction method with rollback support

## Context

Implement the transaction<T> method of NodeDatabaseBridge that executes multiple database operations atomically using better-sqlite3's transaction API. Must provide automatic rollback on errors and proper isolation.

## Implementation Requirements

- Implement `transaction<T>(callback: (db: DatabaseBridge) => Promise<T>): Promise<T>`
- Use better-sqlite3's transaction() method for atomic operations
- Provide transaction-scoped DatabaseBridge instance to callback
- Handle automatic commit on success and rollback on errors
- Support nested transactions if callback uses other bridge methods

## Technical Approach

1. Create better-sqlite3 transaction using db.transaction()
2. Create transaction-scoped DatabaseBridge wrapper
3. Execute callback with transaction-scoped bridge instance
4. Handle Promise resolution/rejection for commit/rollback logic
5. Ensure proper error propagation and cleanup
6. Support both sync and async callback patterns

## Method Implementation Template

```typescript
async transaction<T>(callback: (db: DatabaseBridge) => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  // Create transaction function using better-sqlite3
  const transactionFn = this.db.transaction((db: DatabaseBridge) => {
    // Execute callback with transaction-scoped database
    // Handle async operations within transaction
  });

  try {
    // Execute transaction with proper error handling
    // Return result from callback
  } catch (error) {
    // Log transaction failure
    // Convert and rethrow appropriate error
  }
}
```

## Transaction-Scoped Bridge

Create wrapper that:

- Inherits from same database connection within transaction
- Uses same prepared statement approach
- Maintains transaction context for all operations
- Prevents explicit commit/rollback calls from callback

## Error Handling Requirements

- Automatic rollback on any callback error or exception
- Convert transaction-specific errors to TransactionError types
- Preserve original error context and stack traces
- Log transaction attempts, successes, and failures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] transaction<T> method implemented following interface signature
- [ ] Uses better-sqlite3 transaction API for atomic operations
- [ ] Callback receives transaction-scoped DatabaseBridge instance
- [ ] Automatic commit on successful callback completion
- [ ] Automatic rollback on callback errors or exceptions
- [ ] Proper error conversion to TransactionError types
- [ ] Generic return type matches callback return type
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for transaction lifecycle events

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for successful transaction completion and commit
- [ ] Unit tests for transaction rollback on callback errors
- [ ] Unit tests for nested database operations within transaction
- [ ] Unit tests for transaction error handling and conversion
- [ ] Unit tests for generic type inference with different callback returns
- [ ] Integration tests with actual database operations
- [ ] Mock better-sqlite3 transaction API for isolated testing

## Security Considerations

- Ensure transaction isolation prevents data race conditions
- Validate that transaction scope doesn't leak outside callback
- Handle transaction timeouts appropriately
- Prevent transaction deadlocks through proper error handling

## Performance Requirements

- Transaction overhead adds <10ms to operation time
- Efficient handling of multiple operations within single transaction
- Memory usage scales with transaction complexity
- Proper cleanup of transaction resources

## Dependencies

- T-implement-query-method-with (query method implemented)
- T-implement-execute-method-for (execute method implemented)
- TransactionError types from shared package
- better-sqlite3 Database transaction API

## Implementation Notes

- better-sqlite3 transactions are synchronous, wrap in Promise for interface
- Consider using immediate transaction execution vs deferred
- Handle both successful and failed transaction scenarios
- Follow existing error handling and logging patterns in codebase
- Include JSDoc with transaction usage examples and best practices
