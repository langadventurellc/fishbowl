log:
  - >-
    Successfully implemented comprehensive connection management methods for
    NodeDatabaseBridge including enhanced close() and isConnected() methods with
    logging and robust error handling.


    Key improvements implemented:

    - Added structured logging throughout connection lifecycle (initialization,
    closure, and state changes)

    - Enhanced close() method with idempotent behavior and comprehensive error
    handling

    - Added proper resource cleanup with connection state tracking

    - Implemented graceful error handling that maintains connection state
    consistency

    - Added comprehensive unit test coverage for all new functionality including
    edge cases


    The implementation follows all task requirements:

    - close() is idempotent and handles multiple calls gracefully

    - isConnected() accurately reflects database connection status

    - Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

    - Thread-safe connection state management

    - Proper error handling with ConnectionError types

    - Full test coverage with 58 passing test cases


    All quality checks pass including linting, formatting, and TypeScript
    compilation.

# Implement connection management methods (close, isConnected)

## Context

Implement the connection lifecycle methods of NodeDatabaseBridge including close() for resource cleanup and the optional isConnected() method for connection state tracking. Ensures proper database cleanup during application shutdown.

## Implementation Requirements

- Implement `close(): Promise<void>` for database connection cleanup
- Implement optional `isConnected?(): boolean` for connection state checking
- Handle proper resource cleanup and connection state management
- Ensure thread-safe connection state tracking
- Support graceful shutdown scenarios

## Technical Approach

1. Implement close() method using better-sqlite3's close() API
2. Update connection state tracking on close operations
3. Implement isConnected() to check current connection status
4. Handle multiple close() calls gracefully (idempotent)
5. Prevent operations on closed connections with appropriate errors

## Method Implementation Template

```typescript
async close(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    // Check if already closed (idempotent)
    // Close better-sqlite3 database connection
    // Update connection state
    // Log closure event
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle close errors appropriately
    // Log error context
  }
}

isConnected(): boolean {
  // Return current connection state
  // Check if database object is valid and open
}
```

## Connection State Management

- Track connection state with private boolean flag
- Update state on successful connection and closure
- Validate state before all database operations
- Handle edge cases like forced disconnections

## Error Handling Requirements

- Handle close() errors gracefully (connection already closed, etc.)
- Update connection state even if close() encounters errors
- Prevent operations on closed connections with ConnectionError
- Log connection lifecycle events for debugging

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] close() method implemented following interface signature
- [ ] Uses better-sqlite3 close() API for connection cleanup
- [ ] Updates connection state tracking on closure
- [ ] Handles multiple close() calls gracefully (idempotent behavior)
- [ ] isConnected() method returns accurate connection status
- [ ] Prevents database operations after close() with appropriate errors
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for connection lifecycle events
- [ ] Proper resource cleanup and memory management

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for successful database connection closure
- [ ] Unit tests for multiple close() calls (idempotent behavior)
- [ ] Unit tests for isConnected() accuracy before and after closure
- [ ] Unit tests for preventing operations on closed connections
- [ ] Unit tests for close() error handling scenarios
- [ ] Mock better-sqlite3 Database for isolated testing
- [ ] Integration tests with actual database connection lifecycle

## Security Considerations

- Ensure sensitive data is not retained after connection closure
- Prevent unauthorized access to closed database connections
- Handle connection state securely to prevent race conditions
- Log connection events for security monitoring

## Performance Requirements

- close() operation completes quickly (<50ms)
- isConnected() check has minimal overhead (<1ms)
- No memory leaks after connection closure
- Efficient state tracking without performance impact

## Dependencies

- T-create-nodedatabasebridge (NodeDatabaseBridge class exists)
- ConnectionError types from shared package
- better-sqlite3 Database close() API
- Existing logger utility for lifecycle event logging

## Implementation Notes

- Make close() idempotent to handle multiple shutdown attempts
- Consider graceful vs forced connection closure scenarios
- Update all operation methods to check connection state first
- Follow existing resource cleanup patterns in codebase
- Include JSDoc with connection management best practices
