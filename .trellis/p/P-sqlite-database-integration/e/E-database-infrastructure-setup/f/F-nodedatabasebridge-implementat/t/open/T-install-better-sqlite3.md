# Install better-sqlite3 dependency and types

## Context

Install the better-sqlite3 SQLite driver for Node.js and its TypeScript types as dependencies for the desktop application package. This is a prerequisite for implementing the NodeDatabaseBridge.

## Implementation Requirements

- Add better-sqlite3 version ^11.x to desktop package dependencies
- Add @types/better-sqlite3 to desktop package devDependencies
- Verify compatibility with existing Electron and Node.js versions
- Update package.json in apps/desktop/ directory

## Technical Approach

1. Install better-sqlite3 as production dependency (needed at runtime)
2. Install @types/better-sqlite3 as dev dependency (TypeScript types)
3. Check for any peer dependency warnings or conflicts
4. Run pnpm install to verify successful installation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] better-sqlite3 ^11.x added to apps/desktop/package.json dependencies
- [ ] @types/better-sqlite3 added to apps/desktop/package.json devDependencies
- [ ] Package installs successfully without errors
- [ ] No peer dependency conflicts with existing packages
- [ ] Dependencies are available for import in TypeScript files

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Verify import statement works: `import Database from 'better-sqlite3';`
- [ ] Confirm TypeScript compilation with better-sqlite3 types
- [ ] Run `pnpm install` from project root to validate lockfile

## Security Considerations

- Use specific version ranges to avoid supply chain vulnerabilities
- Verify package integrity through pnpm lockfile
- Review better-sqlite3 for known security issues

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundational step for NodeDatabaseBridge implementation.
