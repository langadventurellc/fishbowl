# Create DatabaseResult Type Definitions

## Context

This task creates the foundational type definitions for database operation results that will be used by the DatabaseBridge interface. These types ensure type safety for database operations and provide a consistent structure for both query results and execution results.

**Related Trellis Objects:**

- Feature: F-databasebridge-interface (DatabaseBridge Interface Definition)
- Epic: E-database-infrastructure-setup (Database Infrastructure Setup)
- Project: P-sqlite-database-integration (SQLite Database Integration for Fishbowl Desktop)

**Existing Patterns:**
Follow the FileSystemBridge pattern in `packages/shared/src/services/storage/FileSystemBridge.ts` for interface design and type definitions.

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### File Creation

Create `packages/shared/src/services/database/types/DatabaseResult.ts` with:

1. **DatabaseResult Interface**
   - Generic result type for database operations
   - Properties for affected rows, last insert ID, and changes
   - Compatible with both better-sqlite3 and expo-sqlite return values

2. **QueryResult Interface**
   - Generic type for SELECT query results
   - Array-based results with proper typing
   - Support for empty result sets

3. **ExecutionResult Interface**
   - Results for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
   - Properties: lastInsertRowid, changes, affectedRows
   - Error information if operation fails

### Technical Approach

```typescript
// Example structure (implement fully)
export interface DatabaseResult {
  lastInsertRowid?: number;
  changes: number;
  affectedRows: number;
}

export interface QueryResult<T = unknown> {
  rows: T[];
  metadata?: QueryMetadata;
}

export interface ExecutionResult extends DatabaseResult {
  success: boolean;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Type Design Principles

- Use generics for flexible typing while maintaining type safety
- Ensure compatibility with both better-sqlite3 and expo-sqlite APIs
- Support for both successful operations and error states
- Clear distinction between query and execution result types

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Type Definitions

- [ ] DatabaseResult interface created with proper typing
- [ ] QueryResult generic interface supports any row type
- [ ] ExecutionResult interface extends DatabaseResult appropriately
- [ ] QueryMetadata interface for additional query information

### TypeScript Compliance

- [ ] All types compile without errors in strict mode
- [ ] Generic constraints properly defined where needed
- [ ] No use of `any` types - all properly typed
- [ ] Compatible with better-sqlite3 return types

### Documentation

- [ ] Complete JSDoc for all exported types
- [ ] Usage examples in type documentation
- [ ] Clear descriptions of when to use each type
- [ ] Type parameter documentation for generics

### File Organization

- [ ] File created at exact path: `packages/shared/src/services/database/types/DatabaseResult.ts`
- [ ] Proper TypeScript exports for all public types
- [ ] Follows existing naming conventions in the codebase

## Testing Requirements

Include unit tests in the same file or adjacent test file:

### Compilation Tests

- [ ] Test generic type inference with sample data types
- [ ] Verify compatibility with both sqlite driver result formats
- [ ] Test type narrowing for success/error states
- [ ] Validate generic constraints work as expected

### Type Safety Tests

- [ ] Ensure proper typing for empty result sets
- [ ] Test error state typing and inference
- [ ] Verify metadata typing works correctly
- [ ] Test union types for different operation results

## Security Considerations

### Type Safety

- No runtime validation needed (compile-time types only)
- Ensure types prevent unsafe operations
- Generic constraints prevent type confusion

### Input Validation

- Types should enforce proper data structures
- No potential for type coercion issues
- Clear separation between success and error states

## Dependencies

- None (foundational types)
- Must be completed before DatabaseBridge interface creation

## Estimated Time

1-2 hours for complete implementation including tests and documentation
