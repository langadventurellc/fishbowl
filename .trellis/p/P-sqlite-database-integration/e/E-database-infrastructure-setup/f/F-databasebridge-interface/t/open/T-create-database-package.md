# Create Database Package Exports and Organization

## Context

This task creates the barrel export files and package organization for the database module, providing a clean public API for the DatabaseBridge interface and related types. This ensures proper encapsulation and makes the database module easy to import and use from other parts of the application.

**Related Trellis Objects:**

- Feature: F-databasebridge-interface (DatabaseBridge Interface Definition)
- Epic: E-database-infrastructure-setup (Database Infrastructure Setup)
- Project: P-sqlite-database-integration (SQLite Database Integration for Fishbowl Desktop)

**Existing Patterns:**
Follow the barrel export pattern used in `packages/shared/src/services/storage/index.ts` and other service modules for consistent API organization.

**Dependencies:**

- DatabaseBridge interface from T-create-core-databasebridge
- Result types from T-create-databaseresult-type
- Error types from T-create-databaseerror-type
- Query options from T-create-queryoptions

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### File Creation

Create the following files:

1. **Main Package Index**: `packages/shared/src/services/database/index.ts`
   - Export DatabaseBridge interface
   - Export all type definitions
   - Export error classes
   - Export configuration options
   - Re-export common types for convenience

2. **Types Package Index**: `packages/shared/src/services/database/types/index.ts`
   - Barrel export for all type definitions
   - Organized exports by category
   - Clear type groupings

3. **Package Directory Structure Validation**
   - Ensure proper directory structure exists
   - Validate file organization follows codebase patterns
   - Check that all files are properly positioned

### Technical Approach

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/services/database/index.ts
export { DatabaseBridge } from "./DatabaseBridge";
export type {
  DatabaseResult,
  QueryResult,
  ExecutionResult,
} from "./types/DatabaseResult";
export {
  DatabaseError,
  ConnectionError,
  QueryError,
  TransactionError,
  DatabaseErrorCode,
} from "./types/DatabaseError";
export type {
  QueryOptions,
  TransactionOptions,
  ConnectionOptions,
} from "./types/QueryOptions";

// packages/shared/src/services/database/types/index.ts
export type {
  DatabaseResult,
  QueryResult,
  ExecutionResult,
} from "./DatabaseResult";
export {
  DatabaseError,
  ConnectionError,
  QueryError,
  TransactionError,
  DatabaseErrorCode,
} from "./DatabaseError";
export type {
  QueryOptions,
  TransactionOptions,
  ConnectionOptions,
} from "./QueryOptions";
```

### Organization Principles

- Clear separation between interfaces, types, and implementations
- Logical grouping of related exports
- Consistent naming conventions
- Easy-to-discover API surface
- Follow existing package organization patterns

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### File Structure

- [ ] Main index file created at `packages/shared/src/services/database/index.ts`
- [ ] Types index file created at `packages/shared/src/services/database/types/index.ts`
- [ ] All files follow existing codebase directory patterns
- [ ] Proper TypeScript exports for all public APIs

### Export Organization

- [ ] DatabaseBridge interface prominently exported
- [ ] All result types exported with clear naming
- [ ] Error classes and error codes exported
- [ ] Configuration option types exported
- [ ] Type-only exports properly marked

### API Consistency

- [ ] Export naming follows codebase conventions
- [ ] Public API surface is minimal and focused
- [ ] Internal implementation details not exposed
- [ ] Clear distinction between types and classes

### Integration

- [ ] Exports can be imported from main package index
- [ ] Types work correctly with TypeScript autocomplete
- [ ] No circular dependency issues
- [ ] Compatible with existing service patterns

## Testing Requirements

Include tests to validate the package organization:

### Import Tests

- [ ] Test importing DatabaseBridge from main package
- [ ] Test importing specific types from main package
- [ ] Test importing from types subpackage
- [ ] Verify no circular dependencies exist

### Type Export Tests

- [ ] Test TypeScript compilation with imported types
- [ ] Verify type-only exports work correctly
- [ ] Test generic type preservation through exports
- [ ] Validate error type imports and usage

### API Surface Tests

- [ ] Verify only intended APIs are exported
- [ ] Test that internal types are not exposed
- [ ] Validate export naming consistency
- [ ] Check autocomplete functionality works

## Security Considerations

### API Surface

- Only export public interfaces and types
- No internal implementation details exposed
- Clear boundaries between public and private APIs

### Type Safety

- Proper TypeScript exports maintain type safety
- No any types leaking through exports
- Generic constraints preserved through exports

## Performance Requirements

### Import Performance

- Efficient barrel exports with no circular dependencies
- Tree-shaking friendly export structure
- Minimal runtime overhead for exports

### Build Performance

- Fast TypeScript compilation of exports
- Efficient module resolution
- No complex re-export chains

## Dependencies

- Must wait for all previous tasks to complete
- DatabaseBridge interface must exist
- All type files must be created
- Package structure must be in place

## Estimated Time

30 minutes for creating exports and validating package organization
