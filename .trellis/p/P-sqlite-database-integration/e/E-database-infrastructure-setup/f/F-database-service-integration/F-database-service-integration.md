# Database Service Integration

## Purpose and Functionality

Integrate the database infrastructure into the Electron main process lifecycle, ensuring proper initialization, service registration, and graceful shutdown. This feature wires up the NodeDatabaseBridge with the existing service architecture and handles application lifecycle events.

## Key Components to Implement

### Service Registration

- Register NodeDatabaseBridge in MainProcessServices
- Dependency injection setup for other services
- Service initialization order management
- Configuration management for database options

### Application Lifecycle Integration

- Database initialization on app startup
- Graceful shutdown on app exit
- Error recovery and fallback strategies
- Health check capabilities

### Service Dependencies

- Integration with existing FileSystemBridge pattern
- Logger integration for database operations
- Configuration service integration
- Error reporting to existing error handling

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### MainProcessServices Integration

- [ ] NodeDatabaseBridge instantiated in MainProcessServices constructor
- [ ] Database service accessible to other main process services
- [ ] Proper error handling during service initialization
- [ ] Database path configuration using userData directory

### Application Startup

- [ ] Database connection established during app startup
- [ ] Database file created if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Directory creation with proper permissions
- [ ] Startup errors logged and handled gracefully

### Application Shutdown

- [ ] Database connection closed on app exit
- [ ] Pending transactions completed before shutdown
- [ ] Proper cleanup of resources
- [ ] Shutdown timeout handling

### Error Recovery

- [ ] Database corruption detection and recovery
- [ ] Permission error handling with user feedback
- [ ] Disk space error detection
- [ ] Fallback to read-only mode if needed

### Service Architecture

- [ ] Follow existing service pattern in the codebase
- [ ] Singleton pattern for database service
- [ ] Lazy initialization if beneficial
- [ ] Thread-safe service access

## Implementation Guidance

### Service Registration Pattern

```typescript
export class MainProcessServices {
  readonly fileSystemBridge: NodeFileSystemBridge;
  readonly databaseBridge: NodeDatabaseBridge;
  readonly cryptoUtils: NodeCryptoUtils;
  // ... other services

  constructor() {
    this.fileSystemBridge = new NodeFileSystemBridge();
    this.databaseBridge = new NodeDatabaseBridge(this.getDatabasePath());
    // ... initialize other services
  }

  private getDatabasePath(): string {
    const userDataPath = app.getPath("userData");
    return path.join(userDataPath, "fishbowl.db");
  }
}
```

### Lifecycle Management

- Hook into Electron's app.whenReady() for initialization
- Register app.on('before-quit') for cleanup
- Handle app.on('window-all-closed') appropriately

### Error Handling Strategy

- Log all database errors with context
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Implement graceful degradation where possible
- Report critical errors to main window

### Directory and File Management

- Ensure userData directory exists
- Create database file with proper permissions
- Handle cross-platform path differences
- Backup considerations for future

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Test service initialization with mocked dependencies
- [ ] Test error scenarios during startup
- [ ] Test cleanup during shutdown
- [ ] Verify proper service registration

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Test full application lifecycle with database
- [ ] Verify database file creation and permissions
- [ ] Test service interaction patterns
- [ ] Validate error propagation

### Error Scenario Tests

- [ ] Database file locked by another process
- [ ] Insufficient disk space during initialization
- [ ] Corrupted database file handling
- [ ] Permission denied scenarios

## Security Considerations

### File System Security

- Database file created with user-only permissions
- Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Ensure database directory is within userData

### Process Security

- Database access restricted to main process
- No database credentials or secrets stored
- Secure cleanup of sensitive data on shutdown

### Access Control

- Service access controlled through dependency injection
- No global database access patterns
- Proper service encapsulation

## Performance Requirements

### Startup Performance

- Database initialization completes within 500ms
- Non-blocking startup where possible
- Efficient service dependency resolution
- Minimal impact on app launch time

### Runtime Performance

- Service lookup overhead <1ms
- Efficient resource cleanup
- Minimal memory footprint for service management

### Shutdown Performance

- Graceful shutdown completes within 2 seconds
- No data loss during forced shutdown
- Efficient resource cleanup

## Dependencies

- Electron app module for lifecycle events
- path module for cross-platform file paths
- Existing MainProcessServices pattern
- Logger service for error reporting
