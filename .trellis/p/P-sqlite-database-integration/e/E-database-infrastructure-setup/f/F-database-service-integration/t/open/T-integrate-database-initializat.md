# Integrate database initialization into app startup lifecycle

## Context

The MainProcessServices now includes NodeDatabaseBridge, but the database initialization needs to be properly integrated into the Electron application startup sequence. The database should be initialized after services are created but before the main window opens.

## Implementation Requirements

### Database Initialization

- Add database initialization step after MainProcessServices instantiation in `main.ts`
- Ensure database connection is established before creating the main window
- Add comprehensive error handling for database startup failures
- Include logging for database initialization success and failure cases

### Directory Creation

- Ensure userData directory exists before database initialization
- Create database file path directory structure if it doesn't exist
- Handle permission issues during directory creation
- Add appropriate error messages for filesystem issues

### Error Handling Strategy

- Catch and log database initialization errors with context
- Provide user-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios
- Implement graceful degradation or application exit on critical database failures
- Consider retry logic for transient failures

### Startup Sequence Integration

- Initialize database after MainProcessServices creation but before window creation
- Add database ready state validation before proceeding with UI
- Ensure proper error propagation to application startup error handling
- Add startup timing logs for performance monitoring

## Technical Approach

### Integration Point

Add database initialization in `app.whenReady()` callback after services creation:

```typescript
// After mainProcessServices = new MainProcessServices()
try {
  // Database is already connected via constructor, verify connection
  if (!mainProcessServices.databaseBridge.isConnected()) {
    throw new Error("Database connection failed during initialization");
  }
  logger.info("Database initialized successfully");
} catch (error) {
  logger.error("Database initialization failed", error);
  // Handle startup failure appropriately
}
```

### Directory Validation

- Check if userData directory exists and is writable
- Create database parent directory if needed
- Handle permission errors with user-friendly messages

### Error Recovery

- Implement appropriate error handling strategy (graceful degradation vs. application exit)
- Consider fallback mechanisms for non-critical database failures
- Add user notification for database issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database initialization added to app startup sequence
- [ ] Database connection verified before main window creation
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for database startup failures
- [ ] Proper logging of initialization success and failure cases
- [ ] Directory creation and permission error handling
- [ ] User-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Application startup completes successfully with working database
- [ ] Startup error handling prevents application from running in invalid state

## Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts` - Add database initialization step
- Potentially add error handling utilities if needed

## Dependencies

- T-add-nodedatabasebridge-to (MainProcessServices integration complete)
- Electron app.getPath() for userData directory
- Node.js fs utilities for directory operations

## Testing Requirements

- Manual testing of successful database initialization
- Testing of error scenarios (permission denied, disk full, etc.)
- Verification that application doesn't start with invalid database state
- Integration testing with existing startup sequence

## Security Considerations

- Ensure database file is created with appropriate permissions
- Validate userData path to prevent directory traversal
- Handle sensitive error information appropriately in logs
