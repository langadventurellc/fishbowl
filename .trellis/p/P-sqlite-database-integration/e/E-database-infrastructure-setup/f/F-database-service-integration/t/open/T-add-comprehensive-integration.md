# Add comprehensive integration tests for database lifecycle

## Context

The feature requires integration tests that verify the full application lifecycle with database initialization, service integration, and cleanup. These tests ensure the complete database service integration works correctly across startup, runtime, and shutdown scenarios.

## Implementation Requirements

### Application Lifecycle Testing

- Test full application startup with database initialization
- Verify database connection is established before main window creation
- Test application shutdown with proper database cleanup
- Validate service integration works correctly across the entire lifecycle

### Database File and Directory Testing

- Test database file creation in userData directory
- Verify proper directory structure and permissions
- Test cross-platform path handling and file operations
- Validate database file persistence across application restarts

### Service Integration Validation

- Test MainProcessServices with database bridge integration
- Verify service dependency resolution works correctly
- Test service factory methods with real database connections
- Validate error propagation through service layers

### Error Scenario Integration Testing

- Test startup failures with database unavailable
- Test permission denied scenarios during initialization
- Test disk space issues during database operations
- Test corrupted database file recovery scenarios

## Technical Approach

### Test Suite Structure

Create comprehensive integration test file:

```typescript
// apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/database-lifecycle.integration.test.ts

describe("Database Lifecycle Integration", () => {
  describe("Application Startup", () => {
    // Test database initialization during app startup
  });

  describe("Service Integration", () => {
    // Test MainProcessServices with database
  });

  describe("Error Recovery", () => {
    // Test error scenarios and recovery
  });

  describe("Application Shutdown", () => {
    // Test database cleanup during shutdown
  });
});
```

### Test Environment Setup

- Use temporary directories for test databases
- Mock Electron app.getPath() for controlled test environments
- Create test fixtures for various database states
- Implement cleanup utilities for test isolation

### Real Database Testing

- Use actual SQLite databases (not mocks) for integration tests
- Test with real file system operations
- Verify actual database connections and operations
- Test performance characteristics under realistic conditions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Full application lifecycle integration tests created
- [ ] Database initialization tested in realistic startup scenario
- [ ] Service integration validated with real database connections
- [ ] Database cleanup tested in shutdown scenarios
- [ ] Error recovery scenarios tested with real error conditions
- [ ] Cross-platform path and file operations tested
- [ ] Performance validation for startup/shutdown timing requirements
- [ ] Test suite provides confidence in production deployment
- [ ] All integration tests pass consistently in CI environment

## Files to Create

- `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/database-lifecycle.integration.test.ts` - Main integration test suite
- `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/test-utils/database-test-helpers.ts` - Test utilities (optional)

## Dependencies

- T-integrate-database-initializat (Database startup integration)
- T-implement-database-cleanup-in (Database shutdown integration)
- Jest testing framework
- Temporary file system utilities for test isolation

## Testing Requirements

- Integration tests run with real SQLite database
- Tests validate actual file system operations
- Error scenarios tested with realistic failure conditions
- Performance testing validates startup/shutdown timing requirements
- Tests run reliably in CI environment without flakiness
- Test cleanup ensures no test artifacts remain

## Test Scenarios

### Startup Scenarios

- Successful database initialization with new file
- Database initialization with existing file
- Startup failure due to permission denied
- Startup with corrupted database file
- Startup with insufficient disk space

### Runtime Scenarios

- Service creation and database operations
- Health check functionality during runtime
- Database connection state management
- Error handling and recovery during operations

### Shutdown Scenarios

- Graceful shutdown with database cleanup
- Forced shutdown handling
- Shutdown with active database operations
- Multiple shutdown requests handling

## Performance Validation

- Startup sequence completes within performance requirements
- Database initialization within 500ms requirement
- Shutdown cleanup within 2 seconds requirement
- Memory usage and resource cleanup validation

## CI Integration

- Tests run in GitHub Actions or similar CI environment
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Test artifacts cleaned up properly
- Reliable test execution without environmental dependencies
