# Add database health check and error recovery mechanisms

## Context

The feature requirements include health check capabilities and error recovery strategies for database operations. This includes detection of database corruption, permission errors, and disk space issues with appropriate user feedback and fallback mechanisms.

## Implementation Requirements

### Health Check Implementation

- Create a `performDatabaseHealthCheck()` function in MainProcessServices
- Implement basic connectivity and integrity checks
- Add simple query validation (SELECT 1) to verify database operations
- Include logging and error reporting for health check results

### Error Detection Mechanisms

- Database corruption detection through SQLite integrity checks
- Permission error detection and user-friendly messaging
- Disk space error detection and monitoring
- Connection state validation and recovery

### Recovery Strategies

- Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add database corruption recovery through backup restoration
- Create fallback to read-only mode for permission issues
- Provide user notifications for critical database issues

### Integration with Application Lifecycle

- Run health checks during application startup after database initialization
- Add periodic health monitoring during application runtime
- Integrate with existing error handling and logging systems
- Provide health status to other services as needed

## Technical Approach

### Health Check Method

Add to MainProcessServices:

```typescript
async performDatabaseHealthCheck(): Promise<{
  isHealthy: boolean;
  issues: string[];
  canRecover: boolean;
}> {
  const issues: string[] = [];

  try {
    // Check connection
    if (!this.databaseBridge.isConnected()) {
      issues.push('Database connection not established');
      return { isHealthy: false, issues, canRecover: true };
    }

    // Basic query test
    await this.databaseBridge.query('SELECT 1');

    // Integrity check (optional - can be expensive)
    // await this.databaseBridge.execute('PRAGMA integrity_check');

    return { isHealthy: true, issues: [], canRecover: true };
  } catch (error) {
    // Analyze error type and determine recovery options
    // Return appropriate health status
  }
}
```

### Error Recovery Logic

- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Add database reconnection logic
- Create backup and restore functionality integration
- Handle permission and disk space errors with user guidance

### User Feedback Integration

- Create user-friendly error messages for common database issues
- Add notification mechanisms for critical database problems
- Provide guidance for manual recovery steps when needed
- Log technical details while showing simple messages to users

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database health check method added to MainProcessServices with unit tests
- [ ] Basic connectivity and integrity validation implemented
- [ ] Error detection for corruption, permissions, and disk space issues
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms for transient connection failures
- [ ] User-friendly error messages and notifications for critical issues
- [ ] Integration with application startup health validation
- [ ] Logging of health check results and recovery attempts
- [ ] Fallback to read-only mode for permission issues when appropriate
- [ ] Documentation of health check API and error recovery strategies

## Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/MainProcessServices.ts` - Add health check method
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/__tests__/MainProcessServices.test.ts` - Add health check tests
- Potentially `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts` - Integrate health checks into startup

## Dependencies

- T-add-nodedatabasebridge-to (Database service integration complete)
- NodeDatabaseBridge methods (query, isConnected, etc.)
- Existing logging and error handling infrastructure

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for health check method with various error scenarios
- Mock database failures to test error detection
- Recovery mechanism testing with simulated issues
- Integration testing with application startup sequence
- Performance testing to ensure health checks don't impact startup time

## Error Scenarios to Handle

- Database file corruption or invalid format
- Database file locked by another process
- Insufficient disk space for database operations
- Permission denied accessing database file
- Database schema version mismatches
- Network or filesystem I/O errors

## Performance Considerations

- Health checks should complete quickly during startup (< 100ms)
- Avoid expensive operations like full integrity checks during routine monitoring
- Implement efficient retry strategies with appropriate timeouts
- Cache health status to avoid repeated checks

## User Experience

- Provide clear, actionable error messages for database issues
- Guide users through common recovery scenarios
- Avoid technical jargon in user-facing error messages
- Offer manual recovery options when automated recovery fails
