affectedFiles:
  apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/index.ts: Created new barrel export file
    for conversation hooks with JSDoc documentation, usage examples, and clean
    import interface for useConversations, useCreateConversation, and
    useConversation hooks
  apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/__tests__/index.test.ts:
    Created comprehensive unit test suite with 5 test cases verifying all hooks
    are properly exported, no unexpected exports exist, and imports work
    correctly without circular dependencies
log:
  - Successfully created conversations hooks barrel export file with
    comprehensive testing. Implemented
    `apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/index.ts` that exports all three
    conversation hooks (useConversations, useCreateConversation,
    useConversation) with proper JSDoc documentation and usage examples. Created
    corresponding test suite that verifies all exports work correctly, no
    circular dependencies exist, and TypeScript compilation succeeds. All
    quality checks (lint, format, type-check) pass successfully.

# Create conversations hooks barrel export

## Context

Create a barrel export file for all conversation hooks to provide clean imports and maintain consistent module organization following established patterns in the codebase.

**Directory**: `apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/`

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create Index File

- Create `apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/index.ts`
- Export all conversation hooks from a single entry point

### 2. Export Pattern

```typescript
// Conversation hooks
export { useCreateConversation } from "./useCreateConversation";
export { useConversations } from "./useConversations";
export { useConversation } from "./useConversation";

// Export types if needed
export type { UseCreateConversationResult } from "./useCreateConversation";
export type { UseConversationsResult } from "./useConversations";
export type { UseConversationResult } from "./useConversation";
```

### 3. Update Main Hooks Index

- Update `apps/desktop/src/hooks/index.ts` if it exists
- Add conversations export to main hooks barrel
- Follow existing patterns for hook organization

### 4. Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments explaining hook purposes
- Include usage examples in comments
- Document common patterns and best practices

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] index.ts file created in conversations directory
- [ ] All conversation hooks exported
- [ ] Hook result types exported if available
- [ ] Main hooks index updated (if exists)
- [ ] JSDoc documentation added
- [ ] No circular dependency issues
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] Clean import paths for components

## Dependencies

- All implemented conversation hooks
- Existing hooks directory structure
- TypeScript module system

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests verifying:
  - All hooks importable from index
  - No circular dependencies
  - TypeScript types resolve correctly
  - Existing hook exports still work
  - Barrel export doesn't break other imports

## Technical Notes

Follow established patterns:

- Consistent export organization
- Type exports use `export type` syntax when appropriate
- Alphabetical ordering of exports
- Comment sections for different hook categories
- Integration with existing hook structure

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive information in barrel exports
- Maintain module boundaries
- No implementation details exposed through exports

## Performance Requirements

- No runtime performance impact
- Efficient module loading
- Support for tree shaking
- Minimal bundle size impact
