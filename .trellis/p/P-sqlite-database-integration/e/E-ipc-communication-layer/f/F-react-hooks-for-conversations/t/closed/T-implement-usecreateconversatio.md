affectedFiles:
  apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/useCreateConversation.ts:
    Created comprehensive React hook for conversation creation with loading
    states, error handling, reset functionality, and Electron environment
    validation. Includes full TypeScript interfaces and JSDoc documentation.
  apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/__tests__/useCreateConversation.test.tsx:
    Created extensive unit test suite with 14 test cases covering
    initialization, successful creation scenarios, error handling, environment
    validation, reset functionality, and memory cleanup patterns.
log:
  - Successfully implemented useCreateConversation hook with comprehensive state
    management, error handling, and testing. The hook provides a clean, reactive
    interface for conversation creation with loading states, error management,
    and proper cleanup. All tests pass and code meets quality standards with
    full TypeScript typing, proper useCallback optimization, and security
    validation for Electron environment. Implementation follows established
    patterns from existing useConversations hook.

# Implement useCreateConversation hook

## Context

Create a React hook for creating conversations with loading state management and error handling. This provides a clean, reactive interface for the "New Conversation" button functionality.

**Directory**: `apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/`

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create Hook File

- Create `apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/useCreateConversation.ts`
- Follow established React hook patterns from existing codebase

### 2. Hook Implementation

```typescript
interface UseCreateConversationResult {
  createConversation: (title?: string) => Promise<Conversation>;
  isCreating: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
  reset: () => void;
}

export function useCreateConversation(): UseCreateConversationResult {
  // State management
  // Implementation logic
  // Error handling
  // Return hook interface
}
```

### 3. State Management

- `isCreating`: boolean state for loading indicator
- `error`: Error state for error handling and display
- Proper state updates with useState

### 4. Main Function

- `createConversation`: Async function accepting optional title
- Call `window.api.conversations.create(title)`
- Set loading state during operation
- Clear error state on new attempts
- Return created conversation on success

### 5. Error Handling

- Catch all errors from IPC calls
- Store error in state for UI display
- Re-throw error for component-level handling
- Provide reset function to clear error state

### 6. Performance Optimization

- Use useCallback for createConversation function
- Proper dependency arrays
- Cleanup on component unmount

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hook file created in conversations directory
- [ ] Hook returns isCreating, error, createConversation, reset
- [ ] createConversation accepts optional title parameter
- [ ] Loading state managed correctly during async operation
- [ ] Error state updated on failures and cleared on success
- [ ] Error state clearable via reset function
- [ ] Promise resolution returns Conversation object
- [ ] Promise rejection maintains error for component handling
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for all return types
- [ ] Proper useCallback optimization
- [ ] No memory leaks or stale closures

## Dependencies

- React hooks (useState, useCallback)
- window.api.conversations from preload
- Conversation type from @fishbowl-ai/shared
- Completed preload API implementation

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests covering:
  - Initial state is correct
  - createConversation function works with and without title
  - Loading state toggles during operation
  - Error handling and state management
  - Reset function clears error state
  - Promise resolution and rejection behavior
  - No memory leaks in hook usage
  - Proper cleanup on unmount

## Technical Notes

Follow React best practices:

- Functional component patterns
- Proper dependency management
- State initialization
- Effect cleanup
- Performance optimization
- TypeScript strict typing

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data stored in hook state
- Validate responses from IPC calls
- Handle malformed or unexpected responses
- Don't expose internal error details to UI

## Performance Requirements

- Hook initialization < 1ms
- State updates minimize re-renders
- Efficient error state management
- No blocking operations in hook
