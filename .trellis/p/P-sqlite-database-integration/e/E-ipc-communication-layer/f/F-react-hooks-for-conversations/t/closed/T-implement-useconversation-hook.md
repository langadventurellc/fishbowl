  - Successfully implemented useConversation React hook for fetching single
    conversations by ID with comprehensive loading states, error handling, and
    not found detection. The hook includes basic UUID validation, Electron
    environment detection, ID change handling, manual refetch capability, and
    proper memory cleanup. Added 22 unit tests covering all functionality
    including initialization, successful fetches, UUID validation, error
    handling, environment detection, ID changes, refetch functionality, loading
    state management, and memory cleanup. All tests pass and quality checks are
    clean.

# Implement useConversation hook

## Context

Create a React hook for fetching a single conversation by ID with loading states and error handling. This hook supports conversation detail views and navigation.

**Directory**: `apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/`

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create Hook File

- Create `apps/desktop/src/hooks/conversations/useConversation.ts`
- Follow established React hook patterns

### 2. Hook Interface

```typescript
interface UseConversationResult {
  conversation: Conversation | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
  notFound: boolean;
  refetch: () => Promise<void>;
}

export function useConversation(id: string | null): UseConversationResult {
  // State management
  // Effect for fetching by ID
  // Handle ID changes
  // Return hook interface
}
```

### 3. State Management

- `conversation`: Single Conversation object or null
- `isLoading`: Boolean for loading state
- `error`: Error state for failures
- `notFound`: Boolean for not found case

### 4. Fetching Logic

- Use useEffect to fetch when ID changes
- Only fetch when ID is provided and valid
- Set loading state during fetch operation
- Handle conversation not found (null result)
- Clear previous data when ID changes

### 5. ID Change Handling

- Re-fetch when ID parameter changes
- Clear previous conversation and error state
- Handle null ID gracefully (no fetch)
- Validate ID format (basic UUID check)

### 6. Error Handling

- Differentiate between not found and actual errors
- Store errors in state for UI display
- Clear errors on successful fetch
- Log errors for debugging

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hook accepts id parameter (string | null)
- [ ] Returns conversation, isLoading, error, notFound, refetch
- [ ] Fetches conversation when valid ID provided
- [ ] Updates when ID parameter changes
- [ ] Handles null ID without fetching
- [ ] Distinguishes not found from errors
- [ ] Clears previous data on ID change
- [ ] Basic UUID format validation
- [ ] Proper loading state management
- [ ] refetch function for manual refresh
- [ ] No unnecessary API calls

## Dependencies

- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- window.api.conversations.get from preload
- Conversation type from @fishbowl-ai/shared
- UUID validation utility (basic regex)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests covering:
  - Fetch behavior with valid ID
  - Handling of invalid/null ID
  - ID change triggers new fetch
  - Not found vs error scenarios
  - Loading state management
  - Manual refetch functionality
  - Effect cleanup on unmount
  - UUID validation logic

## Technical Notes

Follow React patterns:

- Effect dependencies include ID parameter
- Cleanup function in useEffect if needed
- useCallback for refetch function
- Proper state initialization
- Efficient re-render management

## Security Considerations

- Basic UUID format validation to prevent injection
- Handle unexpected response formats gracefully
- Don't expose sensitive conversation details
- Validate conversation data structure

## Performance Requirements

- Single conversation fetch < 100ms
- Efficient ID change handling
- No duplicate requests for same ID
- Proper memoization where applicable
- Clean effect dependencies
