# Register conversations handlers in main.ts

## Context

Integrate the conversations IPC handlers into the main Electron process startup sequence, following the established pattern used for other IPC handlers.

**Reference Implementation**: See how `setupAgentsHandlers()` is called in `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts`

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Import Handler Setup Function

- Add import for `setupConversationsHandlers` from `./conversationsHandlers.js`
- Place import with other handler imports (agents, personalities, etc.)

### 2. Register Handlers During Startup

- Call `setupConversationsHandlers()` in app.whenReady() handler
- Place call with other handler setup calls
- Wrap in try-catch block for error handling

### 3. Error Handling

```typescript
// Setup Conversations IPC handlers
try {
  setupConversationsHandlers();
  mainProcessServices?.logger?.debug(
    "Conversations IPC handlers registered successfully",
  );
} catch (error) {
  mainProcessServices?.logger?.error(
    "Failed to setup conversations IPC handlers",
    error as Error,
  );
}
```

### 4. Logging

- Debug log on successful registration
- Error log if handler setup fails
- Consistent logging pattern with other handlers

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Import statement added for setupConversationsHandlers
- [ ] Handler setup called in app.whenReady() sequence
- [ ] Try-catch block wraps handler setup call
- [ ] Success logging matches existing pattern
- [ ] Error logging matches existing pattern
- [ ] Handler registration occurs before window creation
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing handler setup

## Dependencies

- Completed `T-implement-conversations-ipc` task
- Existing main.ts handler registration pattern
- MainProcessServices logger instance

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests verifying:
  - setupConversationsHandlers is called during startup
  - Success case logs appropriate message
  - Error case logs error without crashing app
  - Handler registration order is maintained
  - No interference with existing handlers

## Technical Notes

Follow the exact pattern used for other IPC handler registration:

- Same import location and naming
- Identical try-catch error handling structure
- Same logging message format and level
- Consistent placement in startup sequence

## Security Considerations

- Handler registration occurs in secure main process
- Error handling prevents startup failures
- No sensitive information in log messages
- Proper error isolation from other handlers
