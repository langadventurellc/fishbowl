# User Feedback and Notifications

## Purpose and Functionality

Enhance the new conversation creation flow with comprehensive user feedback including loading indicators, success notifications, error messages, and smooth transitions. This feature ensures users always understand the system's state and receive clear feedback about their actions.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Loading States

- Visual loading spinner during conversation creation
- Button text changes to indicate processing
- Smooth transition animations between states

### 2. Success Notifications

- Toast/notification on successful conversation creation
- Brief success indicator with conversation title
- Auto-dismiss after appropriate duration

### 3. Error Handling Display

- User-friendly error messages for common failures
- Retry option when creation fails
- Clear indication of what went wrong

### 4. State Transitions

- Smooth visual transitions between idle/loading/success/error states
- Prevent jarring UI changes
- Maintain visual consistency during state changes

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Loading Indicators

- [ ] Loading spinner appears immediately on button click
- [ ] Button text changes from "New Conversation" to "Creating..."
- [ ] Loading state prevents additional clicks
- [ ] Loading indicator is visible but not intrusive
- [ ] Spinner animation is smooth and consistent with app design

### Success Feedback

- [ ] Success toast/notification appears after conversation creation
- [ ] Notification includes the new conversation title or ID
- [ ] Success message auto-dismisses after 3-5 seconds
- [ ] Success feedback doesn't block further interactions
- [ ] Visual confirmation that action completed successfully

### Error Handling

- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly (not technical jargon)
- [ ] Different error types show appropriate messages:
  - Network/connection errors
  - Database errors
  - Permission errors
  - Validation errors
- [ ] Error messages include actionable next steps
- [ ] Retry button/option available on failure
- [ ] Errors are logged for debugging while showing friendly message to user

### Visual Polish

- [ ] All state transitions use appropriate animations (150-200ms)
- [ ] Color changes follow theme variables
- [ ] Focus states are clearly visible
- [ ] Loading spinner matches application's design system
- [ ] No layout shift during state changes

### Accessibility

- [ ] Screen readers announce state changes
- [ ] Error messages are announced to assistive technology
- [ ] Loading state indicated via aria-busy
- [ ] Success/error states use appropriate ARIA live regions
- [ ] Color is not the only indicator of state

## Technical Requirements

### UI Components

- Use existing toast/notification system if available, or implement simple one
- Leverage shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement with React hooks for state management

### Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
try {
  const result = await createConversation();
  showSuccessNotification(`Created "${result.title}"`);
} catch (error) {
  const userMessage = mapErrorToUserMessage(error);
  showErrorNotification(userMessage);
  logger.error("Failed to create conversation", error);
}
```

### State Management

- Track UI state: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'
- Manage notification visibility and auto-dismiss timers
- Handle cleanup on component unmount

## Implementation Guidance

### Toast/Notification System

1. Check if app has existing toast system
2. If not, implement simple notification component
3. Position notifications appropriately (top-right or bottom-center)
4. Ensure notifications stack if multiple appear

### Error Message Mapping

- Connection errors → "Unable to connect. Please check your connection."
- Permission errors → "You don't have permission to create conversations."
- Validation errors → "Invalid conversation data. Please try again."
- Generic errors → "Something went wrong. Please try again."

### Animation Approach

- Use CSS transitions for smooth state changes
- Implement fade-in/fade-out for notifications
- Add subtle scale animation for button state changes
- Ensure animations respect prefers-reduced-motion

### File Modifications

- `apps/desktop/src/pages/Home.tsx` - Add notification handling
- Create `apps/desktop/src/components/notifications/` if needed
- Potentially add `apps/desktop/src/utils/errorMessages.ts` for error mapping

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing

- Test all error scenarios (disconnect database, invalid data, etc.)
- Verify notifications appear and auto-dismiss
- Test with screen reader for accessibility
- Test with keyboard navigation only
- Test rapid clicking and error recovery

### Unit Tests

- Test error message mapping function
- Test notification auto-dismiss timing
- Test state transition logic
- Mock various error types and verify handling
- Test accessibility attributes

### Error Scenarios to Test

- Database connection failure
- Network timeout
- Invalid input data
- Permission denied
- Concurrent creation attempts

## Dependencies

- Feature 1 (Core Button Integration) must be complete
- Need to identify or implement notification system
- Error types from shared package must be available

## Success Metrics

- All user actions provide clear feedback within 100ms
- Error messages help users understand and resolve issues
- Success notifications confirm action completion
- No silent failures - all errors are communicated
- Accessibility audit passes for all states

## Security Considerations

- Don't expose technical error details to users
- Log full error details for debugging
- Sanitize any user input shown in notifications
- Don't reveal system internals in error messages
