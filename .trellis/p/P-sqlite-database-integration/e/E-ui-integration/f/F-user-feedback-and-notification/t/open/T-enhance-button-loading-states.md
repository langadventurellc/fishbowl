# Enhance button loading states with animations

## Context

The NewConversationButton already has basic loading states, but this task enhances them with smooth animations and better visual feedback. The button should provide clear visual indication of the creation process.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Enhance Loading Spinner Animation

- Verify the Loader2 spinner from lucide-react is animating smoothly
- Adjust animation speed if needed (currently using animate-spin)
- Ensure spinner size is appropriate (currently h-4 w-4)
- Add subtle fade-in for spinner appearance

### 2. Add Button State Transitions

- Implement smooth transitions between states (idle → loading → idle)
- Add CSS transitions for background color changes
- Prevent layout shift when text changes
- Use consistent transition duration (150-200ms)

### 3. Improve Button Text Changes

- Smoothly transition between "New Conversation" and "Creating..."
- Consider using a fixed width to prevent button resize
- Maintain button height during state changes
- Ensure text remains centered

### 4. Add Micro-interactions

- Add subtle scale animation on button press
- Implement hover state with smooth transition
- Add focus-visible styles for keyboard users
- Ensure disabled state is visually distinct

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Loading spinner fades in smoothly
- [ ] Button maintains consistent size during state changes
- [ ] Background color transitions smoothly
- [ ] No layout shift when switching states
- [ ] Hover state has smooth transition
- [ ] Active/pressed state has micro-animation
- [ ] Disabled state is clearly visible
- [ ] Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- [ ] All transitions complete within 200ms

## Technical Approach

```typescript
// In NewConversationButton.tsx or via className
const buttonClasses = cn(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2",
  "transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out",
  "hover:scale-[1.02] active:scale-[0.98]",
  "focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2",
  "min-w-[160px]", // Prevent size changes
  loading && "cursor-wait",
  className
);

// CSS for smooth spinner entrance
.spinner-enter {
  animation: fadeIn 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: scale(0.8); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: scale(1); }
}

// Respect motion preferences
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

## Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/conversations/NewConversationButton.tsx` - Enhance with animations
- Potentially add animation utilities to global CSS if needed

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests (include in this task)

- Test component has transition classes
- Test prefers-reduced-motion is respected
- Verify button maintains min-width
- Test disabled state applies correct styles
- Mock matchMedia for motion preference tests

### Manual Testing

- Click button and observe smooth transition to loading
- Verify no layout shift during state change
- Test hover and active states
- Check with prefers-reduced-motion enabled
- Test keyboard focus styles
- Verify animations on different browsers

## Dependencies

- NewConversationButton component exists
- Tailwind CSS transition utilities available
- Browser supports CSS transitions

## Performance Considerations

- Keep animations lightweight (transform/opacity only)
- Avoid animating properties that trigger reflow
- Use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
- Ensure animations don't impact interaction responsiveness

## Accessibility Considerations

- Respect prefers-reduced-motion setting
- Ensure focus states are clearly visible
- Don't rely solely on color for state indication
- Maintain WCAG contrast ratios in all states

## Time Estimate

1-1.5 hours including animation testing and browser compatibility
