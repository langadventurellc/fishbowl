# UI Components and Feedback

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement the user interface components for conversation creation, including the "New Conversation" button, loading states, and user feedback mechanisms. This feature delivers the visible elements that users interact with to create new conversations in the desktop application.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. New Conversation Button Component

- Add button to Home.tsx using existing shadcn/ui Button component
- Position appropriately within the existing layout
- Implement proper styling consistent with application design system
- Support keyboard shortcuts for accessibility

### 2. Loading States

- Visual loading indicator during conversation creation
- Button disabled state while operation is in progress
- Prevent double-click/multiple submissions
- Smooth transitions between states

### 3. User Feedback System

- Success feedback when conversation is created
- Error message display for failures
- Clear visual state changes throughout the process
- Accessible feedback for screen readers

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Button Implementation

- [ ] "New Conversation" button added to Home.tsx in appropriate location
- [ ] Button uses existing shadcn/ui Button component with consistent styling
- [ ] Button has clear, descriptive label "New Conversation"
- [ ] Button is keyboard accessible (Tab navigation, Enter/Space activation)
- [ ] Button has appropriate aria-label for screen readers
- [ ] Button tooltip shows keyboard shortcut if implemented

### Loading State Management

- [ ] Button shows loading spinner/indicator when clicked
- [ ] Button is disabled during creation process
- [ ] Loading state prevents multiple simultaneous requests
- [ ] Loading indicator is visually clear and consistent with app design
- [ ] Loading state automatically clears on success or error

### User Feedback Implementation

- [ ] Success feedback displayed when conversation is created successfully
- [ ] Error messages shown when creation fails
- [ ] Feedback messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Feedback is accessible to screen readers (aria-live regions)
- [ ] Feedback auto-dismisses after appropriate duration (success: 3s, error: 5s)
- [ ] Error messages include retry option where appropriate

### Visual Design Requirements

- [ ] All UI states follow existing design system
- [ ] Color scheme matches application theme
- [ ] Transitions are smooth (100-200ms)
- [ ] Focus states are clearly visible
- [ ] Hover states provide appropriate feedback

### Accessibility Requirements

- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all components
- [ ] Keyboard navigation fully functional
- [ ] Screen reader announcements for all state changes
- [ ] Focus management after conversation creation
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards

## Technical Requirements

### Component Structure

- Use functional React components with TypeScript
- Implement proper prop types and interfaces
- Follow existing component patterns in the codebase
- Use React.memo where appropriate for performance

### State Management

- Local component state for UI-specific states
- Proper cleanup of any side effects
- Consistent state updates to prevent race conditions

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation for network/API failures
- User-friendly error messages (no technical jargon)
- Logging of detailed errors for debugging
- Fallback UI for critical failures

## Implementation Guidance

### File Structure

```
apps/desktop/src/
├── components/
│   ├── conversations/
│   │   ├── NewConversationButton.tsx
│   │   └── ConversationFeedback.tsx
│   └── ui/
│       └── (existing shadcn components)
└── pages/
    └── Home.tsx (modified)
```

### Component Integration Pattern

```typescript
// In Home.tsx
import { NewConversationButton } from '@/components/conversations/NewConversationButton';

// Within render
<NewConversationButton
  onSuccess={handleConversationCreated}
  onError={handleCreationError}
/>
```

### Feedback System Approach

Since no toast component exists, implement inline feedback:

- Use alert-dialog or dialog components for errors requiring user action
- Implement inline success/error messages near the button
- Consider adding a simple notification area if multiple feedbacks needed

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Button renders correctly in all states
- [ ] Click handler is called appropriately
- [ ] Loading state prevents multiple clicks
- [ ] Feedback messages display correctly
- [ ] Accessibility attributes are present

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Button integrates properly with Home.tsx
- [ ] State changes flow correctly through components
- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works end-to-end

### Visual Testing

- [ ] All UI states look correct
- [ ] Transitions are smooth
- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Dark/light theme compatibility (if applicable)

## Dependencies on Other Features

- Requires State Management feature for hook implementation
- Will integrate with IPC layer (already completed)
- No external library dependencies beyond existing shadcn/ui

## Performance Requirements

- Button response within 100ms of user interaction
- Smooth animations at 60fps
- No layout shift when showing feedback
- Minimal re-renders during state changes

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data exposed in UI
- Error messages don't reveal system internals
- Proper sanitization of any user input (if applicable)
- XSS prevention in feedback messages
