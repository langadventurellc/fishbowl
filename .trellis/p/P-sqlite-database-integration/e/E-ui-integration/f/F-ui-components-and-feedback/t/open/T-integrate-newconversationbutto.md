# Integrate NewConversationButton into Home.tsx with Feedback

## Context

This task integrates the NewConversationButton and ConversationFeedback components into the existing Home.tsx page, creating a complete user interface for conversation creation with proper feedback handling. The integration needs to work with the existing layout and maintain visual consistency.

**Related Issues:**

- Feature: F-ui-components-and-feedback
- Epic: E-ui-integration
- Project: P-sqlite-database-integration
- Depends on: T-create-newconversationbutton, T-create-conversationfeedback

**Reference Files:**

- Existing Home.tsx at `apps/desktop/src/pages/Home.tsx`
- Layout patterns throughout the desktop app
- Component integration patterns in existing pages

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### File Modification

Update `apps/desktop/src/pages/Home.tsx` to:

1. **Import New Components**

   ```typescript
   import { NewConversationButton } from "@/components/conversations/NewConversationButton";
   import { ConversationFeedback } from "@/components/conversations/ConversationFeedback";
   ```

2. **Add State Management**

   ```typescript
   const [creationState, setCreationState] = useState<{
     loading: boolean;
     feedback: {
       type: "success" | "error" | null;
       message: string;
     };
   }>({
     loading: false,
     feedback: { type: null, message: "" },
   });
   ```

3. **Implement Event Handlers**
   - `handleCreateConversation`: Main click handler
   - `handleCreationSuccess`: Success callback
   - `handleCreationError`: Error callback
   - `handleFeedbackDismiss`: Feedback dismissal
   - `handleRetryCreation`: Error retry logic

### Layout Integration

1. **Positioning Strategy**
   - Analyze existing Home.tsx layout structure
   - Place button in logical location (header area or main content)
   - Position feedback component near button for context
   - Maintain responsive design for different screen sizes

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Button should be prominent but not overwhelming
   - Feedback should be clearly associated with button
   - Integration should feel natural in existing design
   - Consider existing spacing and typography

3. **Layout Considerations**
   - Prevent layout shift when feedback appears
   - Maintain proper spacing with existing elements
   - Ensure button accessibility in tab order
   - Test on different screen sizes

### Event Handler Implementation

1. **Main Click Handler**

   ```typescript
   const handleCreateConversation = useCallback(async () => {
     setCreationState((prev) => ({ ...prev, loading: true }));

     try {
       // This will be connected to the hook in the next feature
       // For now, simulate the API call
       await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Placeholder

       handleCreationSuccess();
     } catch (error) {
       handleCreationError(error as Error);
     } finally {
       setCreationState((prev) => ({ ...prev, loading: false }));
     }
   }, []);
   ```

2. **Success Handler**
   - Update feedback state with success message
   - Clear any previous error states
   - Optionally trigger navigation or list updates (future)

3. **Error Handler**
   - Display user-friendly error message
   - Log detailed error for debugging
   - Provide retry option when appropriate

4. **Feedback Management**
   - Handle feedback dismissal
   - Implement retry logic that resets state and tries again
   - Auto-dismiss success messages, keep error messages until dismissed

### Placeholder Logic

Since the State Management feature hasn't been implemented yet, include placeholder logic that:

- Simulates loading state
- Shows success/error states
- Provides proper user feedback
- Can be easily replaced with real API calls later

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Integration Requirements

- [ ] NewConversationButton integrated into Home.tsx
- [ ] ConversationFeedback component positioned appropriately
- [ ] Components receive correct props and callbacks
- [ ] Integration maintains existing Home.tsx functionality
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in modified files

### Layout and Visual Design

- [ ] Button positioned logically within existing layout
- [ ] Feedback component positioned near button for context
- [ ] No layout shift when feedback appears/disappears
- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Visual hierarchy maintained with existing elements
- [ ] Consistent spacing with rest of application

### Functionality

- [ ] Button click triggers conversation creation flow
- [ ] Loading state shown during creation process
- [ ] Success feedback displayed after successful creation
- [ ] Error feedback shown when creation fails
- [ ] Retry functionality works for error cases
- [ ] Feedback can be manually dismissed
- [ ] Multiple creation attempts handled gracefully

### User Experience

- [ ] Button click provides immediate feedback
- [ ] Loading state prevents multiple simultaneous requests
- [ ] Success message is encouraging and clear
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works throughout flow
- [ ] Screen reader accessibility maintained

### Performance

- [ ] Component re-renders minimized
- [ ] No memory leaks from event handlers
- [ ] Smooth state transitions
- [ ] Button responds within 100ms of click

### Testing Requirements

**Unit/Integration Tests** (include in same task):

- [ ] Home.tsx renders with new components
- [ ] Button click triggers correct handlers
- [ ] Loading state displays correctly
- [ ] Success flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Error flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Retry functionality works
- [ ] Feedback dismissal works
- [ ] State management is correct

Test file: `apps/desktop/src/pages/__tests__/Home.test.tsx` (modify existing or create)

## Technical Approach

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Analyze Existing Home.tsx**
   - Review current component structure
   - Identify best placement for new components
   - Understand existing state management patterns

2. **Add Imports and Types**

   ```typescript
   import { NewConversationButton } from "@/components/conversations/NewConversationButton";
   import { ConversationFeedback } from "@/components/conversations/ConversationFeedback";

   interface FeedbackState {
     type: "success" | "error" | null;
     message: string;
   }
   ```

3. **Implement State Management**
   - Add state for loading and feedback
   - Use proper TypeScript types
   - Initialize with appropriate defaults

4. **Create Event Handlers**
   - Implement async creation handler
   - Add success and error callbacks
   - Include feedback management functions
   - Use useCallback for performance

5. **Integrate Components in JSX**
   - Add components to render method
   - Position appropriately in layout
   - Pass correct props and callbacks
   - Test responsive behavior

6. **Add Placeholder Logic**
   - Simulate API call with timeout
   - Implement basic success/error paths
   - Add comments for future real implementation
   - Ensure easy replacement later

7. **Testing Implementation**
   - Write tests for integration
   - Test all user flows
   - Verify error handling
   - Check accessibility

### Placeholder API Simulation

```typescript
const simulateConversationCreation = async (): Promise<void> => {
  // Simulate network delay
  await new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(resolve, 800 + Math.random() * 400),
  );

  // Simulate occasional failures for testing
  if (Math.random() < 0.2) {
    throw new Error("Failed to create conversation. Please try again.");
  }

  // Success case
  return;
};
```

### State Management Pattern

```typescript
const [state, setState] = useState({
  loading: false,
  feedback: { type: null as "success" | "error" | null, message: "" },
});

const updateState = (updates: Partial<typeof state>) => {
  setState((prev) => ({ ...prev, ...updates }));
};
```

## Definition of Done

- ConversationFeedback component positioned and working
- All event handlers implemented and working
- Loading states function correctly
- Success and error feedback flows complete
- Placeholder logic ready for real API integration
- Unit tests written and passing
