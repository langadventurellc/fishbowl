# Create Core Conversation Types and Interfaces

## Context

This task creates the foundational TypeScript interfaces and types for the conversation domain model. These types will be used throughout the conversations feature and must follow existing patterns in the codebase.

Reference existing patterns:

- `packages/shared/src/types/llmConfig/` for type organization
- `packages/shared/src/types/settings/` for interface patterns

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create Conversation Interface

File: `packages/shared/src/types/conversations/Conversation.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Represents a conversation entity with metadata
 */
export interface Conversation {
  /** Unique identifier (UUID v4) */
  id: string;
  /** Display title for the conversation */
  title: string;
  /** ISO 8601 timestamp of creation */
  created_at: string;
  /** ISO 8601 timestamp of last update */
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### 2. Create Input Types

File: `packages/shared/src/types/conversations/CreateConversationInput.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Input for creating a new conversation
 */
export interface CreateConversationInput {
  /** Optional title (defaults to "New Conversation") */
  title?: string;
}
```

File: `packages/shared/src/types/conversations/UpdateConversationInput.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Input for updating an existing conversation
 */
export interface UpdateConversationInput {
  /** New title for the conversation */
  title?: string;
}
```

### 3. Create Result Type

File: `packages/shared/src/types/conversations/ConversationResult.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Result of a conversation operation
 */
export type ConversationResult =
  | { success: true; data: Conversation }
  | { success: false; error: Error };
```

### 4. Create Barrel Export

File: `packages/shared/src/types/conversations/index.ts`

- Export all types using `export type` for tree-shaking
- Group exports logically with comments

## Technical Approach

1. Create the conversations directory structure
2. Implement each interface with comprehensive JSDoc comments
3. Use `export type` for all type exports (not `export`)
4. Follow naming conventions from existing types
5. Ensure ISO 8601 format for timestamps

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ All interfaces created with proper JSDoc documentation
- ✓ Types follow existing patterns in the codebase
- ✓ Proper use of `export type` for tree-shaking
- ✓ Comprehensive comments explaining each field
- ✓ Barrel export file properly organized
- ✓ No runtime code, only type definitions

## Testing Requirements

Create unit tests to verify type structure:

- File: `packages/shared/src/types/conversations/__tests__/types.test.ts`
- Use TypeScript's type system to verify interface contracts
- Test type inference and compatibility

## Security Considerations

- Document that ID should be UUID v4 in comments
- Note title length restrictions in comments
- Specify ISO 8601 format for timestamps
