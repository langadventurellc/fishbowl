log:
  - Completed package exports and integration for conversation types feature.
    Updated the main conversations barrel export to include all schemas and
    error classes with proper TypeScript export conventions. Created
    comprehensive export verification test suite covering schemas, errors,
    circular dependencies, and runtime vs type-only exports. All 1,547 tests
    pass and quality checks succeed.

# Update Package Exports and Integration

## Context

Complete the conversation types feature by updating all necessary barrel exports and ensuring proper integration with the shared package structure. This ensures all types are accessible where needed.

Reference:

- `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts` for main types export
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts` for package-level exports

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create Main Conversations Barrel Export

File: `packages/shared/src/types/conversations/index.ts`

```typescript
// Type definitions
export type { Conversation } from "./Conversation";
export type { CreateConversationInput } from "./CreateConversationInput";
export type { UpdateConversationInput } from "./UpdateConversationInput";
export type { ConversationResult } from "./ConversationResult";

// Schemas
export {
  conversationSchema,
  createConversationInputSchema,
  updateConversationInputSchema,
} from "./schemas";

// Inferred types from schemas
export type {
  ConversationSchema,
  CreateConversationInputSchema,
  UpdateConversationInputSchema,
} from "./schemas";

// Error classes
export {
  ConversationNotFoundError,
  ConversationValidationError,
} from "./errors";
```

### 2. Update Types Package Export

File: `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts`
Add to existing exports:

```typescript
// Conversations
export * from "./conversations";
```

### 3. Update Main Package Export (if needed)

File: `packages/shared/src/index.ts`
Verify conversations types are accessible through main export

### 4. Verify Build and Type Checking

- Run `pnpm build:libs` to ensure types compile
- Run `pnpm type-check` to verify no type errors
- Run `pnpm quality` to ensure code quality

## Technical Approach

1. Create comprehensive barrel export for conversations
2. Use `export type` for interfaces, `export` for runtime code
3. Group exports logically with comments
4. Update parent barrel files
5. Verify all exports are accessible

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✓ All conversation types exported through barrel files
- ✓ Proper use of `export type` vs `export`
- ✓ Types accessible from `@fishbowl-ai/shared`
- ✓ No circular dependencies
- ✓ Build completes successfully
- ✓ Type checking passes
- ✓ Quality checks pass

## Testing Requirements

Create export verification test:
File: `packages/shared/src/types/conversations/__tests__/exports.test.ts`

- Verify all expected exports are available
- Test type imports work correctly
- Ensure no runtime code in type exports
- Check for circular dependencies

Run existing test suites:

- `pnpm test` to run all unit tests
- Verify no regressions in existing tests

## Security Considerations

- Ensure error classes don't expose sensitive internals
- Verify no accidental export of internal utilities
- Keep exports minimal and intentional
