# Service Integration

## Purpose and Functionality

Integrate the ConversationsRepository into the main process services architecture, establishing proper dependency injection, service registration, and making the repository available for use by IPC handlers and other services. This feature completes the repository layer by wiring it into the application's service container.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. MainProcessServices Integration

- Add ConversationsRepository property to MainProcessServices class
- Initialize repository with DatabaseBridge and CryptoUtils dependencies
- Ensure proper initialization order with other services
- Add getter method for repository access

### 2. Service Factory Method

- Create factory method for conversation-related services
- Support future expansion with conversation-related services
- Follow existing createDatabaseService pattern
- Enable type-safe service creation

### 3. Repository Interface Registration

- Export ConversationsRepositoryInterface from shared package
- Update barrel exports in services/index.ts
- Ensure proper type exports for tree-shaking
- Add to main shared package exports

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### MainProcessServices Updates

- ✓ ConversationsRepository property added as readonly
- ✓ Repository initialized in constructor after database bridge
- ✓ Proper dependencies (DatabaseBridge, CryptoUtils) injected
- ✓ Repository accessible via getter method
- ✓ Initialization logged for debugging

### Service Factory

- ✓ createConversationService<T> method following existing patterns
- ✓ Generic type support for future services
- ✓ Passes repository as dependency to created services
- ✓ JSDoc documentation with usage examples
- ✓ Type-safe service creation

### Export Structure

- ✓ ConversationsRepositoryInterface exported from shared
- ✓ ConversationsRepository available for desktop implementation
- ✓ All conversation types exported through barrel files
- ✓ Proper separation of interfaces and implementations

### Error Handling

- ✓ Graceful handling if database not initialized
- ✓ Clear error messages for missing dependencies
- ✓ Repository initialization failures don't crash app
- ✓ Proper cleanup in shutdown sequence

## Technical Requirements

### File Updates Required

```
apps/desktop/src/main/services/MainProcessServices.ts
- Import ConversationsRepository and types
- Add conversationsRepository property
- Initialize in constructor
- Add createConversationService method

packages/shared/src/repositories/conversations/index.ts
- Export ConversationsRepositoryInterface
- Export conversation types

packages/shared/src/repositories/index.ts
- Export conversations module

packages/shared/src/services/index.ts
- Include conversations repository exports
```

### Integration Code Pattern

```typescript
// MainProcessServices.ts
export class MainProcessServices {
  readonly conversationsRepository: ConversationsRepository;

  constructor() {
    // After database initialization
    const cryptoUtils = new NodeCryptoUtils();
    this.conversationsRepository = new ConversationsRepository(
      this.databaseBridge,
      cryptoUtils,
    );
  }

  createConversationService<T>(
    ServiceClass: new (repo: ConversationsRepository) => T,
  ): T {
    return new ServiceClass(this.conversationsRepository);
  }
}
```

### Dependencies

- ConversationsRepository from shared package
- NodeCryptoUtils for UUID generation
- Existing DatabaseBridge instance
- Logger for operation tracking

## Implementation Guidance

1. Follow integration pattern from database service setup
2. Ensure initialization order (database must be ready first)
3. Use readonly properties for immutability
4. Include comprehensive logging for debugging
5. Follow existing MainProcessServices patterns
6. Consider future service expansion needs

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Required

- ✓ MainProcessServices constructor with mocks
- ✓ Service factory method behavior
- ✓ Getter methods return correct instances
- ✓ Export structure validation

### Mock Requirements

- Mock entire MainProcessServices for IPC handler tests
- Mock DatabaseBridge for repository testing
- Control service initialization order

## Security Considerations

- Repository only accessible in main process
- No direct database access from renderer
- Validate all IPC calls before repository operations
- Log service initialization for audit trail

## Future Considerations

- Support for conversation message services
- Agent association services
- Conversation search and filtering services
- Migration to support these services without breaking changes
