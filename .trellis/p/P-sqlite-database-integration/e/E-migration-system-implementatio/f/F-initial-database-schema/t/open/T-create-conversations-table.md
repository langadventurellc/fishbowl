# Create conversations table migration SQL file

## Context

This task creates the first migration file `001_create_conversations.sql` that establishes the conversations table schema. This migration sets the pattern for all future migrations and provides the core table for storing conversation data.

**Related Feature**: F-initial-database-schema - Initial Database Schema Migration
**Pattern Reference**: Follow the established naming convention XXX_description.sql and use SQLite best practices
**Integration**: Will be executed by the MigrationService implemented in F-migration-service-core

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create Migration File

- File: `migrations/001_create_conversations.sql`
- Use proper SQLite syntax for all statements
- Include descriptive comments explaining schema decisions
- Follow established migration file conventions

### 2. Conversations Table Schema

- Create table with UUID primary key (stored as TEXT)
- Include required columns: id, title, created_at, updated_at
- Add appropriate constraints and defaults
- Ensure idempotency with IF NOT EXISTS

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- Add index for created_at column for date-based queries
- Add trigger for automatic updated_at timestamp updates
- Keep table structure simple and efficient

## Technical Approach

### SQL Implementation

```sql
-- Migration: Create conversations table
-- Description: Initial table for storing chat conversation metadata

-- Create conversations table for storing chat sessions
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS conversations (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- UUID stored as text (36 characters)
    title TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Human-readable conversation title
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,  -- ISO 8601 format
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP   -- Auto-updated on changes
);

-- Index for efficient date-based queries (newest first)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_conversations_created_at
ON conversations(created_at DESC);

-- Trigger to automatically update updated_at timestamp
CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS update_conversations_updated_at
AFTER UPDATE ON conversations
BEGIN
    UPDATE conversations
    SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE id = NEW.id;
END;
```

### File Organization

- Single migration file focused on conversations table
- Clear comments explaining each section
- Proper SQL statement termination
- Readable formatting for maintenance

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### File Creation

- [ ] `migrations/001_create_conversations.sql` file created
- [ ] File follows XXX_description.sql naming convention
- [ ] File size under 1KB for performance
- [ ] File uses Unix line endings (LF)

### Table Definition

- [ ] conversations table created with correct schema
- [ ] id column as TEXT PRIMARY KEY for UUID storage
- [ ] title column as TEXT NOT NULL for conversation names
- [ ] created_at column with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP default
- [ ] updated_at column with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP default
- [ ] All CREATE statements use IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency

### Performance Features

- [ ] Index created on created_at column for efficient queries
- [ ] Index orders by DESC for newest-first retrieval
- [ ] Trigger created for automatic updated_at updates
- [ ] All indexes and triggers use IF NOT EXISTS

### SQL Quality

- [ ] All SQL statements properly terminated with semicolons
- [ ] Descriptive comments explain schema decisions
- [ ] Valid SQLite 3.x syntax throughout
- [ ] No syntax errors when parsed

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Test migration file exists at expected path
- [ ] Test file content can be read successfully
- [ ] Test SQL syntax is valid (no parse errors)
- [ ] Test file follows naming convention pattern
- [ ] Test file contains required table definition
- [ ] Test file contains required index definitions
- [ ] Test file contains required trigger definition

## Dependencies

- None - this creates foundational schema

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data embedded in migration file
- Proper column constraints prevent invalid data
- Static SQL content prevents injection attacks
- Comments don't expose sensitive implementation details

## Performance Requirements

- Table creation completes in <50ms
- Index creation doesn't significantly impact writes
- File parsing completes in <10ms
- Memory usage minimal during file reading

## Files to Create

- `migrations/001_create_conversations.sql`
- `migrations/__tests__/001_create_conversations.test.ts` (unit tests)

## Integration Notes

- This migration will be discovered by MigrationDiscovery
- Will be executed by MigrationService in numeric order
- Creates foundation for ConversationsRepository operations
- Must complete before application can store conversations
