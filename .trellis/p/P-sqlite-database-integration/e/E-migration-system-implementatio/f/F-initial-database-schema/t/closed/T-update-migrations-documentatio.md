affectedFiles:
  migrations/README.md: Completely rewrote with comprehensive documentation
    covering migration system architecture, naming conventions, SQL best
    practices, execution workflows, platform support, troubleshooting, security
    considerations, and testing guidance. Used conversations migration as
    concrete example throughout.
  migrations/__tests__/README.test.ts:
    Created comprehensive test suite validating
    README documentation completeness, accuracy, formatting, and alignment with
    actual implementation. Tests cover all required sections, examples, best
    practices, and content accuracy.
log:
  - "Updated migrations documentation with comprehensive guide covering the
    implemented migration system. Documented all three core services
    (MigrationService, MigrationDiscovery, MigrationTracking), established clear
    naming conventions, provided concrete examples using the conversations
    migration, and created extensive testing coverage. The documentation now
    includes sections on: system overview, file naming patterns, SQL best
    practices, execution workflows, platform integration, troubleshooting,
    security considerations, and performance guidelines. All quality checks pass
    and comprehensive unit tests validate the documentation completeness."

# Update migrations documentation and establish conventions

## Context

This task updates the migrations/README.md file with comprehensive documentation about the migration system, establishes conventions for future migrations, and provides examples based on the implemented conversations table migration.

**Related Feature**: F-initial-database-schema - Initial Database Schema Migration
**Dependencies**: T-create-conversations-table (uses the conversations migration as an example)
**Integration**: Documentation supports the migration system implemented across all features

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### 1. Update migrations/README.md

- Document the implemented migration system architecture
- Explain migration file naming conventions
- Provide usage examples with the conversations migration
- Include best practices for writing migrations

### 2. Migration Conventions Documentation

- File naming pattern: XXX_description.sql
- SQL formatting and comment standards
- Idempotency requirements (IF NOT EXISTS)
- Transaction behavior and rollback handling

### 3. Usage Instructions

- How migrations are discovered and executed
- Integration with application startup
- Development vs production considerations
- Troubleshooting common migration issues

## Technical Approach

### README Structure

```markdown
# Database Migrations

## Overview

[Migration system architecture and purpose]

## Migration Files

[Naming conventions and file structure]

## Writing Migrations

[Best practices and examples]

## Execution

[How migrations run and integration points]

## Troubleshooting

[Common issues and solutions]
```

### Documentation Content

- Clear explanation of forward-only migration approach
- Examples using the conversations table migration
- Integration with MigrationService
- Platform support (desktop/mobile future)

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### README Updates

- [ ] Overview section explains migration system purpose and architecture
- [ ] Migration file naming convention clearly documented
- [ ] Usage examples include the conversations table migration
- [ ] Best practices section covers SQL formatting and conventions
- [ ] Integration section explains application startup flow

### Convention Documentation

- [ ] File naming pattern XXX_description.sql explained
- [ ] SQL formatting standards specified (comments, semicolons, indentation)
- [ ] Idempotency requirements documented (IF NOT EXISTS usage)
- [ ] Transaction behavior explained (per-migration transactions)
- [ ] Forward-only approach clearly stated (no rollbacks)

### Usage Instructions

- [ ] Migration discovery process documented
- [ ] Execution order explanation (numeric ordering)
- [ ] Application startup integration described
- [ ] Development workflow guidance provided
- [ ] Production deployment considerations covered

### Examples and References

- [ ] conversations table migration used as primary example
- [ ] SQL formatting examples match actual implementation
- [ ] Common patterns demonstrated (tables, indexes, triggers)
- [ ] Error handling scenarios documented
- [ ] File structure examples provided

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Test README file exists and is readable
- [ ] Test README contains required sections
- [ ] Test examples in README are valid
- [ ] Test no broken internal links
- [ ] Test formatting is consistent

## Dependencies

- T-create-conversations-table (provides concrete example for documentation)

## Security Considerations

- Documentation doesn't expose sensitive implementation details
- No database credentials or connection strings in examples
- Security best practices mentioned for migration writing

## Performance Requirements

- Documentation file under 10KB for quick loading
- Examples are concise but comprehensive
- Clear structure for easy navigation

## Files to Create/Modify

- `migrations/README.md` (comprehensive update)
- `migrations/__tests__/README.test.ts` (documentation validation tests)

## Integration Notes

- Documentation supports MigrationService implementation
- Examples align with conversations table schema
- Conventions support both desktop and future mobile platforms
- Guidance enables consistent migration development
