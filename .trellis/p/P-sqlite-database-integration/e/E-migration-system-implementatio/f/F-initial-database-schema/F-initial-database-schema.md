# Initial Database Schema Migration

## Purpose and Functionality

Create the first migration file that establishes the conversations table schema and implement the migration file structure in the migrations directory. This feature delivers the actual SQL migration file and establishes the pattern for future migrations.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Migration File Structure

- Create `001_create_conversations.sql` in `/migrations/` directory
- Establish naming convention for future migrations
- Include comprehensive SQL for table creation

### 2. Conversations Table Schema

- Define table structure with appropriate columns
- Set up primary key and constraints
- Add indexes for query performance
- Include triggers for updated_at timestamp

### 3. Migration Documentation

- Update migrations/README.md with usage instructions
- Document naming conventions and best practices
- Provide examples for future migrations

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Migration File Creation

- [ ] `001_create_conversations.sql` created in migrations directory
- [ ] File contains valid SQLite syntax
- [ ] Follows XXX_description.sql naming pattern

### Conversations Table Schema

- [ ] Table created with following columns:
  - id TEXT PRIMARY KEY (for UUID storage)
  - title TEXT NOT NULL
  - created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  - updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- [ ] Appropriate indexes created for performance
- [ ] Trigger implemented for automatic updated_at updates

### SQL Implementation

- [ ] CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS used for idempotency
- [ ] All SQL statements properly terminated with semicolons
- [ ] Comments included explaining schema decisions
- [ ] Compatible with SQLite version 3.x

### Migration Testing

- [ ] Unit test verifies SQL file exists and is readable
- [ ] Unit test validates SQL syntax (parse check)
- [ ] Unit test confirms expected table structure in SQL

## Technical Requirements

### SQL Schema Definition

```sql
-- Create conversations table for storing chat sessions
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS conversations (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- UUID stored as text
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Index for date-based queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_conversations_created_at
ON conversations(created_at DESC);

-- Trigger to update updated_at on row changes
CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS update_conversations_updated_at
AFTER UPDATE ON conversations
BEGIN
    UPDATE conversations
    SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE id = NEW.id;
END;
```

### File Structure

```
migrations/
├── 001_create_conversations.sql
├── README.md (updated)
└── __tests__/
    └── migrations.test.ts
```

## Implementation Guidance

### Migration File Best Practices

- Use IF NOT EXISTS for all CREATE statements
- Include descriptive comments in SQL
- Keep migrations focused on single purpose
- Ensure forward compatibility

### SQLite Considerations

- TEXT type for UUID storage (36 characters)
- DATETIME stored as TEXT in ISO 8601 format
- Triggers for automated timestamp updates
- Indexes for common query patterns

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Test Coverage

- Verify migration file exists at expected path
- Parse SQL to ensure valid syntax
- Check for required table definition
- Verify index and trigger definitions present
- Test file naming convention compliance

### Validation Tests

- Confirm SQL is valid SQLite syntax
- Check all required columns are defined
- Verify constraints are properly set
- Ensure comments don't break SQL execution

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data in migration files
- Proper column constraints to prevent bad data
- SQL injection not possible (static files)

## Performance Requirements

- Migration file should be under 1KB
- Table creation should complete in <50ms
- Indexes should not impact write performance significantly
