# IPC Chat Bridge

## Purpose and Functionality

Implement the Inter-Process Communication bridge that enables secure communication between the renderer process (UI) and main process (ChatOrchestrationService) for multi-agent chat operations. This bridge provides the secure interface for triggering multi-agent responses and receiving real-time updates.

## Key Components to Implement

### Main Process Chat Handlers (`apps/desktop/src/electron/chatHandlers.ts`)

- IPC handlers for chat operations invoked from renderer
- Integration with ChatOrchestrationService for multi-agent processing
- Event emission for real-time UI updates during agent processing

### Preload Chat API (`apps/desktop/src/electron/preload.ts` - extend existing)

- Secure renderer interface for chat operations
- Type-safe method exposure via contextBridge
- Integration with existing electronAPI structure
  - Expose `chat.onAgentUpdate(listener): () => void` to subscribe to `agent:update` events with an unsubscribe function for cleanup

### TypeScript Definitions (`apps/desktop/src/types/electron.d.ts` - extend existing)

- Interface definitions for chat API methods
- Type safety across IPC boundary
- JSDoc documentation for all chat operations

### IPC Constants (`apps/desktop/src/shared/ipc/chatConstants.ts`)

- Channel name constants for chat operations
- Event type definitions for multi-agent updates
- Request/response type interfaces

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Multi-Agent Coordination Handler

- **GIVEN** renderer needs to trigger multi-agent responses
- **WHEN** `sendToAgents(conversationId, userMessageId)` is called via IPC
- **THEN** the main process handler should:
  - Validate conversationId and userMessageId parameters
  - Invoke ChatOrchestrationService.processUserMessage() in main process
  - Emit `agent:update` events for thinking/complete/error states
  - Support event format: `{ conversationAgentId, status: 'thinking'|'complete'|'error', messageId?, error? }`
  - Handle service errors gracefully and emit appropriate error events
  - Provide optional `all:complete` event when all agents finish
  - Return void (fire-and-forget pattern for parallel processing)

### Real-Time Event Emission

- **GIVEN** ChatOrchestrationService processes multi-agent requests
- **WHEN** agent status changes occur (thinking, complete, error)
- **THEN** the IPC bridge should:
  - Emit consolidated `agent:update` events to renderer
  - Include conversationAgentId for precise UI targeting
  - Provide status differentiation (thinking/complete/error)
  - Include messageId when agent completes successfully
  - Include error message when agent fails
  - Emit events immediately as status changes occur (not batched)
  - Handle multiple simultaneous agent updates efficiently

### Renderer Subscription API

- **GIVEN** the renderer needs to receive agent updates
- **WHEN** the preload exposes the chat API
- **THEN** it should:
  - Provide `window.electronAPI.chat.onAgentUpdate((event) => void): () => void` which registers a listener and returns an unsubscribe function
  - Ensure safe argument handling (no Event object leakage) and proper error handling
  - Support optional `onAllComplete((e) => void)` if `ALL_COMPLETE` is emitted

### Secure Preload Exposure

- **GIVEN** renderer needs access to chat operations
- **WHEN** preload script initializes electronAPI
- **THEN** it should:
  - Expose `window.electronAPI.chat.sendToAgents` method
  - Provide type-safe interface matching main process handler
  - Follow existing preload patterns from messages and conversations APIs
  - Maintain security boundaries (no direct main process access)
  - Handle IPC communication failures gracefully
  - Provide consistent error handling across all chat methods

### Type Safety and Documentation

- **GIVEN** TypeScript integration across process boundary
- **WHEN** defining IPC contracts and interfaces
- **THEN** the implementation should:
  - Define ChatAPI interface with proper JSDoc documentation
  - Extend existing ElectronAPI interface with chat property
  - Provide type definitions for all event payloads
  - Ensure compile-time type checking across IPC boundary
  - Match request/response patterns from existing IPC implementations
  - Document all method signatures and expected behaviors

### Error Handling and Recovery

- **GIVEN** IPC communication or service failures occur
- **WHEN** processing chat operations
- **THEN** the bridge should:
  - Catch and handle ChatOrchestrationService exceptions
  - Emit structured error events with safe error messages
  - Provide error categorization (validation, service, network, etc.)
  - Log detailed errors in main process while emitting safe summaries
  - Handle renderer process disconnection gracefully
  - Support recovery from partial failures during multi-agent processing

### Event Lifecycle Management

- **GIVEN** long-running multi-agent operations
- **WHEN** managing event subscriptions and cleanup
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Support event listener cleanup when conversations change
  - Handle multiple concurrent multi-agent operations per conversation
  - Clean up resources when renderer process exits

### MVP Scope Notes

- Keep the bridge thin: validate inputs, invoke orchestration, and emit events. Do not duplicate business logic in IPC handlers.
- Cancellation and sophisticated event queuing are out of MVP scope; reassess after basic multi-agent flow is stable.

## Implementation Guidance

### Technology Approach

- Follow existing IPC patterns from messagesHandlers.ts and conversationsHandlers.ts
- Use Electron's contextBridge for secure renderer exposure
- Implement proper error boundaries and logging
- Use existing IPC infrastructure and conventions
- Integrate with established MainProcessServices dependency injection

### IPC Channel Design

```typescript
// Main process channels
CHAT_CHANNELS = {
  SEND_TO_AGENTS: "chat:sendToAgents",
} as const;

// Event channels (main â†’ renderer)
CHAT_EVENTS = {
  AGENT_UPDATE: "agent:update",
  ALL_COMPLETE: "all:complete", // optional
} as const;
```

### Event Payload Specifications

```typescript
// agent:update event payload
interface AgentUpdateEvent {
  conversationAgentId: string;
  status: "thinking" | "complete" | "error";
  messageId?: string; // present on 'complete'
  error?: string; // present on 'error'
}

// all:complete event payload (optional)
interface AllCompleteEvent {
  conversationId: string;
}
```

### Security Implementation

- Validate all input parameters in main process handlers
- Sanitize error messages before emitting to renderer
- Use existing security patterns from other IPC handlers
- Never expose main process ChatOrchestrationService directly to renderer
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- Test sendToAgents handler with various input combinations
- Verify proper event emission timing and content
- Test error handling for invalid inputs and service failures
- Validate preload API exposure and type safety
- Test event payload serialization/deserialization

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end test with real ChatOrchestrationService integration
- Test multi-agent scenarios with event timing verification
- Verify IPC communication under load (multiple simultaneous operations)
- Test error propagation from service through IPC to renderer
- Validate event cleanup and memory management

### IPC Communication Tests

- Test IPC channel reliability under various network conditions
- Verify event order preservation during rapid multi-agent updates
- Test communication failure recovery mechanisms
- Validate security boundary enforcement

## Security Considerations

### Process Isolation

- Maintain strict security boundary between renderer and main processes
- Never expose ChatOrchestrationService or repositories directly to renderer
- Validate all IPC inputs in main process before processing
- Sanitize all outputs before sending to renderer

### Data Protection

- Never transmit LLM provider credentials or sensitive configuration to renderer
- Scrub error messages of internal implementation details
- Log security-relevant events for audit purposes
- Implement rate limiting if needed to prevent IPC abuse

### Input Validation

- Validate conversationId and userMessageId exist and are accessible
- Verify user authorization for conversation access
- Sanitize all string inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper error responses for authorization failures

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time

- sendToAgents handler initiation within 50ms
- Event emission within 10ms of status change
- IPC communication latency under 5ms for typical payloads

### Throughput

- Handle multiple simultaneous sendToAgents calls efficiently
- Support rapid event emission during parallel agent processing
- Scale to 5+ concurrent multi-agent operations per conversation

### Resource Usage

- Minimal memory footprint for IPC event queuing
- Efficient serialization/deserialization of event payloads
- Clean resource cleanup when operations complete

## Dependencies

- Existing IPC infrastructure (handlers, preload, type definitions)
- MainProcessServices for dependency injection
- Existing security and validation utilities

### External Dependencies
