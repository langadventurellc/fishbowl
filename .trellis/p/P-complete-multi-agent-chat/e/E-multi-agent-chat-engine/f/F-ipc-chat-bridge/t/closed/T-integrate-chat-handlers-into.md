affectedFiles:
  apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts: Added import for setupChatHandlers from

    alongside other service-dependent handlers (conversations,
    conversationAgents, messages). Chat handlers now properly initialize during
    main process startup with access to MainProcessServices.
log:
  - Successfully integrated chat handlers into main process initialization
    sequence. Added import for setupChatHandlers and registered it alongside
    other service-dependent handlers in the setupIpcHandlers function. The chat
    handlers are now properly initialized with MainProcessServices dependency
    injection during main process startup, following established patterns from
    existing handlers. All quality checks (lint, format, type-check) pass
    successfully.

# Integrate Chat Handlers into Main Process Initialization

## Context

Integrate the chat IPC handlers into the main Electron process initialization sequence, ensuring they are registered alongside existing handlers and have access to the required services through dependency injection.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Integration Points

The chat handlers need to be registered in the main process initialization, likely in:

- `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts` or similar main process entry point
- Alongside other handler registrations (settings, messages, conversations, etc.)

### Handler Registration Pattern

Follow the established pattern from existing handlers:

```typescript
import { setupChatHandlers } from "./chatHandlers";

// In main process initialization
const services = new MainProcessServices();
setupChatHandlers(services);
```

### Service Dependencies

Ensure the chat handlers have access to:

- `MainProcessServices` instance with ChatOrchestrationService
- Proper error handling and logging infrastructure
- WebContents for event emission to renderer processes

### Initialization Sequence

- Register handlers after MainProcessServices initialization
- Ensure ChatOrchestrationService is available and ready
- Handle any initialization errors gracefully
- Log successful handler registration for debugging

### Error Handling During Initialization

- Handle service initialization failures
- Provide fallback behavior if chat handlers can't be registered
- Log initialization errors appropriately
- Don't block other handler registration on chat handler failures

## Acceptance Criteria

**Integration Requirements:**

- ✅ Chat handlers registered in main process initialization
- ✅ Proper dependency injection with MainProcessServices
- ✅ Handler registration follows established patterns
- ✅ Initialization occurs at appropriate point in startup sequence

**Service Access:**

- ✅ Access to ChatOrchestrationService through MainProcessServices
- ✅ WebContents available for event emission
- ✅ Logging infrastructure properly configured
- ✅ Error handling services accessible

**Error Handling:**

- ✅ Graceful handling of initialization failures
- ✅ Appropriate error logging without sensitive information
- ✅ Fallback behavior for chat handler registration failures
- ✅ No blocking of other critical handler registrations

**Testing Requirements:**

- ✅ Unit tests for handler registration functionality
- ✅ Test service dependency injection and access
- ✅ Test error handling during initialization
- ✅ Integration tests with full main process startup
- ✅ Verify handlers are accessible after initialization

## Out of Scope

- Chat handler implementation details (separate task)
- MainProcessServices implementation (already exists)
- Other handler registration logic (already exists)

## Dependencies

- **T-implement-main-process-chat**: Requires chat handlers implementation
- **Existing main process initialization**: Builds on established patterns
- **MainProcessServices**: Requires ChatOrchestrationService to be available

## Security Considerations

- Ensure handlers are only registered in main process
- Proper service access controls and boundaries
- No exposure of sensitive initialization details
- Secure error handling without information leakage

## Performance Considerations

- Minimal impact on main process startup time
- Efficient service dependency resolution
- No blocking operations during handler registration
- Proper resource allocation for event emission capabilities
