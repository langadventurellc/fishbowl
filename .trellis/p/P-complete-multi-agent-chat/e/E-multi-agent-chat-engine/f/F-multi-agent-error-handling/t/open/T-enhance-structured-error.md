# Enhance Structured Error Logging with Security-Safe Observability

## Context

Improve the structured error logging system to provide comprehensive observability for multi-agent error scenarios while maintaining security by never logging sensitive information. Build upon the existing logger infrastructure from `@fishbowl-ai/shared` and the ChatError integration in ChatOrchestrationService.

## Technical Approach

Enhance the logging implementation in `packages/shared/src/services/chat/ChatOrchestrationService.ts` and create logging utilities in `packages/shared/src/services/chat/logging/` to:

1. Structure error logs with consistent schema and correlation context
2. Implement security-safe error message generation
3. Add performance and reliability metrics collection
4. Create correlation IDs for tracing multi-agent operations

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Enhanced Logging Structure

1. **Create logging utilities** (`packages/shared/src/services/chat/logging/ChatErrorLogger.ts`):

   ```typescript
   interface ChatErrorLogEntry {
     correlationId: string;
     conversationId: string;
     agentId: string;
     provider: string;
     operation: string;
     errorType: ChatErrorType;
     errorCode: string;
     safeMessage: string; // Never contains sensitive data
     duration: number;
     timestamp: Date;
     retryable: boolean;
   }
   ```

2. **Correlation ID generation**:
   - Generate unique correlation IDs for multi-agent operations
   - Track operations across all agent processing
   - Enable tracing of complex multi-agent scenarios
   - Support log aggregation and analysis tools integration

### Security-Safe Error Logging

3. **Error sanitization utilities**:

   ```typescript
   class ChatErrorSanitizer {
     static sanitizeError(error: Error, provider: string): SafeErrorDetails {
       // Remove API keys, tokens, internal paths
       // Generate safe technical summaries
       // Preserve debugging context without sensitive data
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Safe logging patterns**:
   - Never log raw exceptions or stack traces with internal paths
   - Scrub sensitive configuration values
   - Generate sanitized technical summaries for debugging
   - Preserve correlation context for traceability

### Performance and Reliability Metrics

5. **Metrics collection**:
   - Track error rates by provider, error type, and agent
   - Monitor processing duration and timeout patterns
   - Collect reliability statistics for observability
   - Support metrics aggregation for monitoring dashboards

6. **Enhanced ChatOrchestrationService logging**:
   - Use correlation IDs for multi-agent operation tracking
   - Log structured error information with full context
   - Include performance metrics in error logs
   - Maintain existing debug/info logging patterns

### Log Aggregation Support

7. **Structured log format**:
   - JSON-structured logs for automated analysis
   - Consistent field naming and data types
   - Support for log parsing and alerting tools
   - Enable correlation across distributed operations

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Structured Error Logging

- ✅ Error logs include correlation IDs for multi-agent operation tracking
- ✅ Log entries have consistent schema with all required context fields
- ✅ Error classification information is properly logged
- ✅ Performance metrics (duration, timing) are included in error logs
- ✅ Log levels are appropriate and consistent with existing patterns

### Security and Safety

- ✅ No API keys, tokens, or credentials are ever logged
- ✅ Stack traces are sanitized to remove internal file paths
- ✅ Error messages are scrubbed of sensitive configuration data
- ✅ Technical details are sanitized while preserving debugging value
- ✅ Logging follows established security patterns from existing codebase

### Observability and Monitoring

- ✅ Error logs support automated parsing and analysis
- ✅ Correlation IDs enable tracing across multi-agent operations
- ✅ Error patterns and trends are identifiable from log data
- ✅ Performance and reliability metrics are consistently collected
- ✅ Log format supports integration with monitoring and alerting tools

### Integration and Performance

- ✅ Logging integration doesn't impact ChatOrchestrationService performance
- ✅ Log generation is efficient and doesn't block agent processing
- ✅ Logging failures are handled gracefully with fallback patterns
- ✅ Integration follows existing logger patterns from `@fishbowl-ai/shared`
- ✅ Memory usage from logging is controlled and predictable

## Testing Requirements

Include comprehensive unit tests covering:

- ChatErrorLogger structured log generation
- Error sanitization and sensitive data scrubbing
- Correlation ID generation and tracking
- Performance metrics collection accuracy
- Log format validation and consistency
- Security validation (no sensitive data in logs)
- Integration with existing logger infrastructure
- Error handling scenarios (logging failures, malformed errors)

## Dependencies

- Requires: T-integrate-error-handling-into (ChatError integration in ChatOrchestrationService)
- Extends: Existing logger infrastructure from `@fishbowl-ai/shared`
- Integrates with: ChatOrchestrationService error handling
- Used by: Monitoring and alerting systems (future)

## Out of Scope

- External log aggregation system setup
- Monitoring dashboard implementation
- Alerting system configuration
- Log retention and archival policies
- Advanced analytics or machine learning on logs
