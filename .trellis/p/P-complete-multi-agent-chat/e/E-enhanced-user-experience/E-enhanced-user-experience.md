# Enhanced User Experience

## Purpose and Goals

Polish the multi-agent chat experience with advanced features, improved error handling, and performance optimizations. This epic transforms the functional MVP into a refined, production-ready application.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### Advanced Error Handling and Recovery

- **Manual Retry System**: Individual agent response retry functionality
- **Cancellation Support**: Cancel in-flight requests when user sends new message
- **Enhanced Error Display**: Detailed error messages with recovery suggestions
- **Timeout Handling**: Graceful handling of slow or stuck agent requests

### Performance Optimizations

- **Large Conversation Handling**: Efficient display and processing of 100+ messages
- **UI Optimizations**: Virtual scrolling and efficient re-rendering for many messages
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup of unused resources and event listeners

### Advanced UX Features

- **Enhanced Thinking Animations**: More sophisticated loading indicators per agent
- **Message Timestamps**: Rich timestamp display with relative times
- **Agent Response Indicators**: Clear visual markers for which agent is responding
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full keyboard navigation and shortcuts for power users

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Manual Retry System

- **GIVEN** an agent response has failed
- **WHEN** user wants to retry the specific agent
- **THEN** it should:
  - Display retry button/option on failed agent messages
  - Allow retry of individual agents without affecting others
  - Rebuild context with current message inclusion states
  - Replace failed message with new attempt (not duplicate)
  - Maintain conversation chronology during retry
  - Show retry attempt indicators to prevent spam clicking

### Request Cancellation

- **GIVEN** agents are currently processing a user message
- **WHEN** user sends a new message or switches conversations
- **THEN** it should:
  - Cancel all pending LLM requests from previous message
  - Clear thinking indicators for cancelled agents
  - Save partial results if any agents had already completed
  - Start new agent processing for the latest user message
  - Prevent orphaned responses from appearing later

### Enhanced Error Display

- **GIVEN** various types of errors occur during agent processing
- **WHEN** displaying error information to users
- **THEN** it should:
  - Show specific error types: network, authentication, rate limiting, context overflow
  - Provide actionable suggestions: "Check internet connection", "Retry in X minutes"
  - Display which specific agent(s) failed with provider information
  - Include error timestamps and basic diagnostic info
  - Offer relevant help links or documentation for common issues
  - Log detailed error info for debugging while showing user-friendly messages

### Timeout Handling

- **GIVEN** agent requests exceed reasonable response times
- **WHEN** managing long-running or stuck requests
- **THEN** it should:
  - Implement configurable timeout per provider (default 60 seconds)
  - Show timeout warning at 45 seconds with option to extend
  - Automatically fail requests that exceed timeout
  - Provide timeout error messages with retry options
  - Cancel timed-out requests to prevent resource leaks
  - Allow users to adjust timeout preferences

### Large Conversation Performance

- **GIVEN** conversations with 100+ messages
- **WHEN** displaying and interacting with chat history
- **THEN** it should:
  - Implement virtual scrolling for efficient rendering (gate behind threshold, e.g., >100 messages or observed jank)
  - Load messages in chunks/pages to reduce memory usage
  - Maintain smooth scrolling performance
  - Optimize message component re-rendering
  - Handle search and navigation efficiently
  - Preserve scroll position during updates

### Context Management and Trimming

- **GIVEN** conversations that exceed LLM context limits
- **WHEN** building context for agent requests
- **THEN** it should:
  - Detect when message history approaches provider limits
  - Implement intelligent message trimming strategies
  - Preserve most recent and system-important messages
  - Show users when context trimming occurs
  - Allow manual context size management
  - Handle different provider limits (OpenAI vs Anthropic)

### Enhanced Thinking Animations

- **GIVEN** agents are processing user messages
- **WHEN** displaying thinking states
- **THEN** it should:
  - Show sophisticated animations: wave, pulse, breathing dots
  - Display estimated time remaining based on historical data
  - Show different animations for different processing stages
  - Include agent avatar/icon in thinking display
  - Animate smoothly between states (thinking → complete → error)
  - Allow users to minimize/expand thinking details

### Rich Timestamp Display

- **GIVEN** messages in conversation history
- **WHEN** displaying temporal information
- **THEN** it should:
  - Show relative times ("2 minutes ago", "Yesterday")
  - Display absolute timestamps on hover
  - Group messages by time periods (Today, Yesterday, etc.)
  - Show processing duration for agent responses
  - Include timezone information for clarity
  - Update relative times periodically

### Keyboard Shortcuts and Navigation

- **GIVEN** users want efficient keyboard interaction
- **WHEN** navigating and using the chat interface
- **THEN** it should:
  - Support Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line
  - Provide shortcuts for agent enable/disable (Ctrl+1-9)
  - Enable keyboard navigation of message history
  - Allow focus management for accessibility
  - Support Escape to cancel current operations
  - Provide shortcut help overlay (Ctrl+?)

### Agent Response Indicators

- **GIVEN** multiple agents responding to messages
- **WHEN** displaying agent activity and results
- **THEN** it should:
  - Show clear visual markers for each agent's messages
  - Display agent avatars consistently
  - Indicate which agents are responding vs idle
  - Show completion order when multiple agents respond
  - Provide visual hierarchy for user vs agent vs system messages
  - Support customizable agent visual themes

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: Optimize for large datasets and many concurrent operations
- **Memory Management**: Prevent memory leaks from cancelled operations
- **Event Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of listeners and subscriptions
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error boundary coverage
- **Accessibility**: Full WCAG compliance for enhanced features

## Dependencies on Other Epics

- **Requires**: E-chat-ui-integration (complete basic chat functionality)
- **Enhances**: All previous epics with polish and advanced features

## Estimated Scale

- **5-6 Features** covering retry, cancellation, performance, and UX enhancements
- **Quality and polish** that makes the application production-ready

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to retry failed agent responses individually without losing other successful responses
- As a user, I want responsive performance even with very long conversation histories
- As a user, I want clear feedback about what's happening when things take time or go wrong
- As a user, I want to efficiently navigate and control the interface with keyboard shortcuts
- As a user, I want sophisticated visual feedback that makes multi-agent interactions feel natural

## Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Handle 500+ messages without noticeable lag
- **Responsiveness**: All UI interactions respond within 100ms
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management for long-running sessions
- **Error Recovery**: 95% of recoverable errors should have clear user actions
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Testing and Validation Requirements

- **Performance Testing**: Verify smooth operation with large datasets
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Comprehensive coverage of error conditions and recovery
- **Timeout Testing**: Verify timeout handling across different network conditions
- **Cancellation Testing**: Ensure proper cleanup when operations are cancelled
- **Accessibility Testing**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **User Experience Testing**: Validate that enhancements genuinely improve usability
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Consistent behavior across different Electron versions
