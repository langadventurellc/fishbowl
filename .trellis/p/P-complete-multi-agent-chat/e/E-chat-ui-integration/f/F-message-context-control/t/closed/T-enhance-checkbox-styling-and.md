# Enhance checkbox styling and accessibility

## Context

The current inclusion checkboxes in MessageItem use basic button styling with checkmarks. To improve user experience and accessibility, these should be enhanced with better visual design, hover states, and comprehensive accessibility features.

## Technical Implementation

**Files to modify:**

- `apps/desktop/src/components/chat/MessageItem.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/components/chat/__tests__/MessageItem.test.tsx`

### Step 1: Improve checkbox visual design

- Replace basic button styling with proper checkbox-like appearance
- Add subtle border, improved spacing, and better visual feedback
- Implement smooth transitions for state changes
- Use consistent design with existing form controls

### Step 2: Add comprehensive hover and focus states

- Add hover effects that provide clear interaction feedback
- Implement focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Ensure hover states work well with both included and excluded states

### Step 3: Enhance accessibility features

- Add comprehensive ARIA labels and descriptions
- Implement proper keyboard navigation (Space/Enter to toggle)
- Add screen reader announcements for state changes
- Ensure high contrast compliance

### Step 4: Add loading state styling

- Design subtle loading indicators (spinner, opacity changes)
- Ensure loading states are accessible to screen readers
- Maintain checkbox visual structure during loading

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Design

- **GIVEN** message inclusion checkboxes
- **WHEN** displayed in different states (included, excluded, loading, error)
- **THEN** each state should have distinct, clear visual appearance
- **AND** styling should be consistent with existing design system

### Interactive States

- **GIVEN** user hovers over or focuses checkbox
- **WHEN** interacting with mouse or keyboard
- **THEN** should show clear visual feedback indicating interactivity
- **AND** hover/focus states should be visually appealing

### Accessibility Compliance

- **GIVEN** user navigates with screen reader or keyboard
- **WHEN** encountering inclusion checkboxes
- **THEN** purpose and state should be clearly announced
- **AND** keyboard navigation should work smoothly (Tab, Space, Enter)

### Loading and Error States

- **GIVEN** checkbox is in loading or error state
- **WHEN** user sees or navigates to checkbox
- **THEN** state should be clearly indicated visually and to assistive technology
- **AND** user should understand what action is happening or what went wrong

## Testing Requirements

Include unit tests for:

- Checkbox rendering in all states (included, excluded, loading, error)
- Hover and focus state styling
- Keyboard interaction handling
- ARIA label and description accuracy
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode compatibility

## Implementation Notes

- Use existing design tokens and CSS variables for consistency
- Implement smooth CSS transitions for state changes
- Ensure checkbox remains usable at different screen sizes
- Consider using existing UI library components if available
- Test with actual screen readers during development

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Hierarchy

- Checkboxes should be noticeable but not dominate message content
- Use subtle visual cues that enhance rather than distract from messages
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment with message layout

### Interaction Feedback

- Hover states should be subtle but clear
- Loading states should be obvious without being jarring
- Error states should indicate problem without alarming users

## Out of Scope

- Do not modify the core checkbox functionality implemented in previous task
- Do not change the MessageItemProps interface
- Do not add new interactive features beyond basic checkbox behavior
- Do not implement custom checkbox components from scratch if good alternatives exist
