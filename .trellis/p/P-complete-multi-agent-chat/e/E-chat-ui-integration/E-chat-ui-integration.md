# Chat UI Integration

## Purpose and Goals

Wire together existing UI components with the new message system and chat engine to create a complete, polished multi-agent chat experience. This epic focuses on user experience, visual feedback, and seamless interaction flows.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### Component Integration (`apps/desktop/src/components/chat/`)

- **MessageInputDisplay Integration**: Connect to useCreateMessage hook with proper validation
- **SendButtonDisplay Integration**: Wire to chat state for sending/loading indicators
- **ChatContainerDisplay Integration**: Connect to useMessages for real-time message display
- **AgentPill Enhancement**: Add thinking indicators tied to useChatStore
- **Message Inclusion**: Wire inclusion checkboxes to `useUpdateMessage` with refetch-on-success

### User Experience Flows

- **Message Sending Flow**: Input → validation → multi-agent processing → results display
- **Visual Feedback System**: Thinking indicators, loading states, error displays
- **Message Context Control**: Inclusion checkbox functionality for message history
- **Error Recovery**: User-friendly error messages with clear next actions

### Real-time UI Updates (`apps/desktop/src/components/chat/`)

- **Live Message Display**: Messages appear as agents complete responses
- **Individual Agent Status**: Per-agent thinking/complete/error states
- **Chronological Message Order**: Stable sorting with timestamps
- **Responsive Input**: Allow typing while agents process, disable send appropriately
- **Mechanics**: Implement “real-time” via refetch-after-create/update and listening to the single `agent:update` channel; no generic event bus

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Message Input Integration

- **GIVEN** user wants to send a message
- **WHEN** interacting with MessageInputDisplay
- **THEN** it should:
  - Connect to useCreateMessage hook for message submission
  - Validate input (non-empty, max length) before sending
  - Show loading state during multi-agent processing
  - Disable send button while `sendingMessage` is true
  - Allow continued typing but prevent submission until all agents complete
  - Clear input field after successful message creation
  - Display validation errors clearly below input field
  - When no agents are enabled: save the user message and append a system message ("No agents are enabled for this conversation"); do not invoke providers

### Send Button Integration

- **GIVEN** message sending interactions
- **WHEN** user clicks send or presses Enter
- **THEN** it should:
  - Connect to useChatStore for sending state
  - Show loading spinner/text during processing
  - Disable button while agents are thinking
  - Re-enable automatically when all agents complete
  - Handle keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line)

### Chat Container Integration

- **GIVEN** a conversation with messages from users and agents
- **WHEN** displaying the chat interface
- **THEN** it should:
  - Connect to useMessages hook for real-time message fetching
  - Display messages in chronological order with stable sorting
  - Sorting stability rule: `created_at ASC, id ASC`
  - Show user messages right-aligned, agent messages left-aligned
  - Include timestamps on all messages
  - Render system/error messages with distinct styling
  - Auto-scroll to bottom when new messages arrive
  - Handle empty conversation state gracefully

### Agent Pill Enhancement

- **GIVEN** agents are processing user messages
- **WHEN** displaying agent status
- **THEN** it should:
  - Connect to useChatStore for per-agent thinking states
  - Show animated thinking indicators (dots, spinner, pulse)
  - Display different states: idle, thinking, complete, error
  - Update indicators immediately when agent status changes
  - Clear thinking state when processing completes
  - Show agent-specific error indicators with hover tooltips

### Message Context Control

- **GIVEN** users need to control message history context
- **WHEN** managing message inclusion
- **THEN** it should:
  - Display checkbox for each message to control inclusion in context
  - Connect to useUpdateMessage hook for inclusion changes
  - Default new messages to included (true)
  - Provide visual indicator of included vs excluded messages
  - Update inclusion status immediately on checkbox change
  - Show context impact (e.g., "X messages included in context")

### Error Display and Recovery

- **GIVEN** LLM provider failures or system errors
- **WHEN** displaying error states
- **THEN** it should:
  - Show agent-specific error messages in chat chronologically
  - Display system messages with distinct styling (different color/icon)
  - Include clear error descriptions without technical jargon
  - Provide manual retry option for failed agent responses
  - Show which specific agents failed vs succeeded
  - Maintain normal flow for successful agents when others fail

### Real-time Updates and Responsiveness

- **GIVEN** multi-agent processing is occurring
- **WHEN** managing UI responsiveness
- **THEN** it should:
  - Update message list immediately when new messages arrive
  - Show individual agent progress without blocking UI
  - Maintain smooth scrolling and interaction during processing
  - Handle rapid successive message sends appropriately
  - Provide clear visual feedback for all state changes
  - Ensure consistent message ordering despite async agent responses

### No Agents Enabled Handling

- **GIVEN** user has disabled all conversation agents
- **WHEN** attempting to send a message
- **THEN** it should:
  - Still save the user message to conversation
  - Display helpful system message: "No agents are enabled for this conversation"
  - Provide clear call-to-action to enable agents
  - Show agent management UI or enable buttons prominently
  - Not attempt any LLM API calls

## Technical Considerations

- **Component Reuse**: Leverage all existing UI components without modification where possible
- **State Management**: Clean separation between transient UI state and persistent data
- **Performance**: Efficient re-rendering with proper React optimization
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of component-level errors
- **Non-Goals (MVP)**: No stream rendering; avoid premature virtualization; use consolidated `agent:update` events only

## Dependencies on Other Epics

- **Requires**: E-multi-agent-chat-engine (chat orchestration and state management)
- **Requires**: E-message-system-foundation (message hooks and persistence)
- **Completes**: The full multi-agent chat experience

## Estimated Scale

- **4-5 Features** covering input integration, display updates, state wiring, and error handling
- **Final integration** that makes the system user-ready

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to type messages naturally and see clear feedback while agents respond
- As a user, I want to see which agents are thinking and which have completed responses
- As a user, I want control over which messages are included in agent context
- As a user, I want clear error messages when things go wrong with specific agents
- As a user, I want the interface to feel responsive even when multiple agents are processing

## Non-functional Requirements

- **Responsiveness**: UI remains interactive during multi-agent processing
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear distinction between user messages, agent responses, and system messages
- **Error Recovery**: Users can understand and act on error states
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **Performance**: Smooth scrolling and updates with 100+ messages

## Testing and Validation Requirements

- **Component Integration**: All existing components work with new hooks and state
- **User Flows**: Complete message sending and receiving flows with multiple agents
- **Error Scenarios**: UI properly handles and displays various error conditions
- **Real-time Updates**: Messages appear correctly as agents complete responses
- **Context Control**: Inclusion checkboxes properly affect subsequent agent responses
- **Edge Cases**: Empty conversations, no enabled agents, rapid message sending
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior across different screen sizes and OS
