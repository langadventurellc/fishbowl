## Purpose and Goals

Build the UI components for the agent management system, including selection dropdowns, form components, and the tab-based interface. All components follow existing patterns and use shadcn/ui consistently.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### Selection Components

- ModelSelect component with LLM config integration
- RoleSelect component using useRolesStore
- PersonalitySelect component using usePersonalitiesStore

### Agent Form Components

- Simplified AgentForm using selection components
- Configuration sliders for temperature, max tokens, top P
- Character counter for text fields
- Form validation with React Hook Form

### Section Components

- Modified AgentsSection with Library and Defaults tabs
- LibraryTab component for agent list display
- DefaultsTab component for default settings
- Remove Templates tab from prototype

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### ModelSelect Component

- ✅ Queries LLM configurations via useLlmConfig hook
- ✅ Maps providers to available models
- ✅ Shows "GPT-4 (OpenAI)" format with provider name
- ✅ Handles empty state with "No LLM configurations" message
- ✅ Updates dynamically when configs change
- ✅ Uses shadcn/ui Select component

### RoleSelect Component

- ✅ Loads roles from useRolesStore
- ✅ Shows role name with optional description preview
- ✅ Handles loading state with spinner
- ✅ Handles error state gracefully
- ✅ Consistent props interface with ModelSelect
- ✅ Uses shadcn/ui Select component

### PersonalitySelect Component

- ✅ Loads personalities from usePersonalitiesStore
- ✅ Shows personality name in dropdown
- ✅ Handles loading state with spinner
- ✅ Handles error state gracefully
- ✅ Consistent props interface with other selects
- ✅ Uses shadcn/ui Select component

### AgentForm Component

- ✅ Uses ModelSelect, RoleSelect, PersonalitySelect components
- ✅ Form validation with React Hook Form and Zod
- ✅ Character counters for name and system prompt
- ✅ Configuration sliders with real-time descriptions
- ✅ Unsaved changes detection
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns - no data fetching

### AgentsSection Updates

- ✅ Remove Templates tab completely
- ✅ Keep Library and Defaults tabs only
- ✅ Remove search functionality from Library
- ✅ Use TabContainer for consistent tab behavior
- ✅ Integration with settings modal navigation

### LibraryTab Component

- ✅ Grid layout for agent cards
- ✅ Create new agent button
- ✅ Empty state when no agents exist
- ✅ No search box (removed per requirements)
- ✅ Responsive design (1 column mobile, 2 columns desktop)

### DefaultsTab Component

- ✅ Temperature slider (0-2) with description
- ✅ Max tokens input (1-4000) with validation
- ✅ Top P slider (0-1) with description
- ✅ Reset to defaults button with confirmation
- ✅ Settings preview panel showing human-readable values

## Technical Considerations

- All components use existing shadcn/ui components
- Follow existing component patterns from roles/personalities
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- No performance optimizations or memoization unless already in existing patterns
- Use existing utilities for keyboard navigation and accessibility

## Dependencies

- E-data-layer-persistence (for types and stores)

## Estimated Scale

- 3-4 features covering selection components, form, and section updates
- Each feature broken into 2-3 focused tasks
- Total: ~10-12 tasks
