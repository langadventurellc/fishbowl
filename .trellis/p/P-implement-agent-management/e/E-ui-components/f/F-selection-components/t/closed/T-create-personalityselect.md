## Context

Create a reusable PersonalitySelect dropdown component that integrates with the existing personalities system. This component will be used in the agent form to allow users to select from available personalities. It should follow the same patterns as RoleSelect and existing PersonalitiesSection components.

## Technical Approach

**File Location**: `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/PersonalitySelect.tsx`

**Dependencies**:

- usePersonalitiesStore from @fishbowl-ai/ui-shared
- shadcn/ui Select component
- Follow patterns from RoleSelect component and `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/`

**Component Interface**:

```typescript
interface PersonalitySelectProps {
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
  placeholder?: string;
}
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **Data Loading**: Use `usePersonalitiesStore` to fetch available personalities
2. **Loading State**: Show spinner while personalities are being fetched
3. **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly error message if personalities fail to load
4. **Empty State**: Handle case when no personalities exist with appropriate message
5. **Selection Display**: Show personality name in dropdown options
6. **Change Handling**: Emit onChange events with selected personality ID

### UI Implementation

1. **Use shadcn/ui Select**: Follow existing Select component patterns
2. **Consistent Styling**: Match design system patterns from RoleSelect and other settings components
3. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
4. **Responsive Design**: Work properly at all screen sizes

### State Management

1. **Subscribe to Store**: Use usePersonalitiesStore selectors for personalities, loading, error states
2. **No Data Persistence**: Component only handles selection, not data persistence
3. **Controlled Component**: Value controlled by parent component

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ Component loads personalities from usePersonalitiesStore on mount
- ✅ Displays loading spinner while `isLoading` is true
- ✅ Shows error message when `error` state exists with retry option
- ✅ Displays personality names in dropdown options
- ✅ Calls onChange with personality ID when selection changes
- ✅ Supports controlled value prop for current selection
- ✅ Handles disabled state properly
- ✅ Shows placeholder text when no personality selected

### Technical Requirements

- ✅ Written in TypeScript with proper interfaces
- ✅ Uses shadcn/ui Select component for rendering
- ✅ Follows React functional component patterns consistent with RoleSelect
- ✅ Includes proper error boundaries if needed
- ✅ Implements proper cleanup for subscriptions

### Accessibility Requirements

- ✅ Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- ✅ Screen reader announcements for state changes
- ✅ Focus management within dropdown

### Testing Requirements

- ✅ Unit tests for component rendering
- ✅ Test loading state display
- ✅ Test error state handling
- ✅ Test successful personality selection
- ✅ Test disabled state behavior
- ✅ Test keyboard navigation
- ✅ Mock usePersonalitiesStore for predictable testing

## Security Considerations

- Validate selected personality ID exists in available personalities
- Sanitize any user-provided placeholder text
- Don't expose internal personality data structures in props

## Performance Requirements

- Component should render instantly (< 50ms)
- Dropdown should open without delay (< 100ms)
- Should not cause unnecessary re-renders of parent components
