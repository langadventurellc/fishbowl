# Add comprehensive form layout and submit/cancel buttons

## Context

Complete the AgentForm implementation by adding proper form layout, submit/cancel buttons with loading states, and final integration of all form components. This task brings together all the previous work into a cohesive, functional form.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Form Layout Structure

```typescript
<Form {...form}>
  <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(handleSave)} className="space-y-6">
    {/* Selection Components Section */}
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {/* Model Selection */}
      {/* Role Selection */}
      {/* Personality Selection */}
    </div>

    {/* Basic Information Section */}
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {/* Agent Name with Character Counter */}
      {/* System Prompt with Character Counter */}
    </div>

    {/* Configuration Section */}
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {/* Temperature Slider */}
      {/* Max Tokens Input */}
      {/* Top P Slider */}
    </div>

    {/* Form Actions */}
    <div className="flex justify-end gap-3 pt-4">
      {/* Cancel and Save buttons */}
    </div>
  </form>
</Form>
```

### Submit/Cancel Button Implementation

```typescript
<div className="flex justify-end gap-3 pt-4 border-t">
  <Button
    type="button"
    variant="outline"
    onClick={handleCancel}
    disabled={isSubmitting}
  >
    Cancel
  </Button>
  <Button
    type="submit"
    disabled={!form.formState.isValid || isSubmitting}
  >
    {isSubmitting && <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />}
    {mode === "edit" ? "Save Changes" : "Create Agent"}
  </Button>
</div>
```

### Form Submission Logic

```typescript
const handleSave = useCallback(
  async (data: AgentFormData) => {
    try {
      setIsSubmitting(true);
      await onSave?.(data);
      form.reset(data, { keepValues: true }); // Clear dirty state
      logger.info("Agent form saved successfully");
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error("Failed to save agent form", { error });
      // Error handling - don't clear dirty state on failure
    } finally {
      setIsSubmitting(false);
    }
  },
  [onSave, form, logger],
);
```

### Error Handling and Loading States

- Display loading spinner on submit button during submission
- Disable form interactions during submission
- Handle submission errors gracefully
- Maintain form state on error (don't clear dirty state)
- Show appropriate error messages

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/AgentForm.tsx`

### Dependencies

- All components from previous tasks
- Button and Loader2 from shadcn/ui and lucide-react
- Form layout patterns from existing forms
- Logger from useServices hook

### Key Implementation Steps

1. Create comprehensive form layout with proper spacing
2. Add form submission handler with error handling
3. Implement submit/cancel buttons with loading states
4. Add proper form validation state handling
5. Integrate logger for form operations
6. Test complete form functionality end-to-end
7. Verify accessibility and keyboard navigation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Form Layout

- ✅ Logical grouping of form sections (selections, basic info, configuration)
- ✅ Consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
- ✅ Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- ✅ Clear visual separation between sections

### Button Functionality

- ✅ Submit button disabled when form is invalid or submitting
- ✅ Cancel button triggers unsaved changes confirmation when needed
- ✅ Loading spinner displays during form submission
- ✅ Button text reflects form mode (Create vs Edit)

### Form Submission

- ✅ Form validates all fields before submission
- ✅ Successful submission calls onSave with form data
- ✅ Error handling preserves form state and shows appropriate messages
- ✅ Loading states prevent duplicate submissions

### Integration

- ✅ All form components work together seamlessly
- ✅ Character counters update in real-time
- ✅ Selection components integrate with form validation
- ✅ Configuration sliders show descriptions correctly

### Accessibility

- ✅ Proper form structure with fieldsets if appropriate
- ✅ Clear focus management throughout form
- ✅ Screen reader friendly button states and labels
- ✅ Keyboard navigation works for all form elements

### Unit Testing Requirements

- Test complete form submission flow
- Test form validation with invalid data
- Test button states during different form states
- Test error handling preserves form data
- Test integration between all form components

## Dependencies

- Requires all previous tasks to be completed
- Uses Button and loading components from shadcn/ui
- Follows form patterns from CreateRoleForm and PersonalityForm

## Security Considerations

- Validate complete form data before submission
- Ensure no sensitive data exposed in error messages
- Prevent double submission during loading state
- Sanitize all form inputs before submission

## Performance Considerations

- Form layout should render efficiently
- No unnecessary re-renders during form interactions
- Loading states should be immediate and responsive
- Form submission should handle large system prompts efficiently

## Notes

- This task completes the AgentForm refactoring
- Test thoroughly with all form features working together
- Ensure consistent styling with existing form patterns
- Verify all acceptance criteria from the feature requirements are met
