    components into AgentForm, replacing inline dropdown logic with consistent
    selection components that follow BaseSelectProps interface. Updated imports
    to include RoleSelect and PersonalitySelect from the shared components
    index. Replaced Input fields for role and personality with their respective
    selection components, ensuring proper form integration through React Hook
    Form Controller pattern. All components now handle their own loading states,
    error handling, and data fetching, achieving clean separation of concerns.
    Quality checks pass and all tests are passing.

# Integrate ModelSelect, RoleSelect, and PersonalitySelect components

## Context

Replace the existing inline dropdown logic in AgentForm with the new selection components (ModelSelect, RoleSelect, PersonalitySelect) that were created in the prerequisite feature F-selection-components. This ensures consistent UI patterns and eliminates code duplication.

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Component Integration

- Import ModelSelect, RoleSelect, PersonalitySelect from `../index`
- Replace any existing dropdown/select logic with these components
- Use FormField with Controller to connect components to React Hook Form
- Ensure all components follow the BaseSelectProps interface

### Form Field Implementation

#### Model Selection Field

```typescript
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="model"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>AI Model</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <ModelSelect
          value={field.value}
          onChange={field.onChange}
          placeholder="Select an AI model"
          disabled={isSubmitting || isLoading}
        />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```

#### Role Selection Field

```typescript
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="role"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Role</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <RoleSelect
          value={field.value}
          onChange={field.onChange}
          placeholder="Select a role"
          disabled={isSubmitting || isLoading}
        />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```

#### Personality Selection Field

```typescript
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="personality"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Personality</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <PersonalitySelect
          value={field.value}
          onChange={field.onChange}
          placeholder="Select a personality"
          disabled={isSubmitting || isLoading}
        />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```

### Clean Separation of Concerns

- Remove any direct data fetching logic from AgentForm
- Selection components handle their own loading states and error handling
- AgentForm focuses purely on form orchestration and validation
- No props drilling of selection data through AgentForm

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/AgentForm.tsx`

### Dependencies

- ModelSelect, RoleSelect, PersonalitySelect from `../index`
- React Hook Form Controller for custom component integration
- Existing form infrastructure from previous task

### Key Implementation Steps

1. Import the three selection components
2. Remove any existing dropdown/select logic if present
3. Add FormField components for model, role, and personality
4. Use Controller to connect selection components to form state
5. Ensure proper validation and error handling
6. Test integration with form submission

## Acceptance Criteria

### Component Integration

- ✅ ModelSelect displays available models grouped by provider
- ✅ RoleSelect shows roles with description previews
- ✅ PersonalitySelect displays personalities with custom instructions
- ✅ All selection components respect disabled state during form submission

### Form Integration

- ✅ Selection values properly update form state
- ✅ Form validation triggers for selection fields
- ✅ Error messages display for required selections
- ✅ Form submission includes selected values

### User Experience

- ✅ Loading states handled by individual selection components
- ✅ Error states with retry functionality work correctly
- ✅ Empty states display appropriate messages
- ✅ Placeholder text is descriptive and consistent

### Data Flow

- ✅ No direct data fetching in AgentForm component
- ✅ Selection components manage their own state
- ✅ Form only orchestrates selection values
- ✅ Clean separation between form logic and data loading

### Unit Testing Requirements

- Test form integration with selection components
- Test that selection changes update form state
- Test validation for required selections
- Test disabled state propagation
- Test form submission with selected values

## Dependencies

- Requires T-set-up-react-hook-form-with to be completed
- Uses selection components from F-selection-components (prerequisite)

## Security Considerations

- Validate that selected IDs correspond to valid options
- Ensure selection components sanitize their own data
- Don't expose internal selection logic through AgentForm
- Validate selections against schema before submission

## Performance Considerations

- Selection components handle their own optimization
- No unnecessary re-renders of selection components
- Form state updates efficiently for selections
- Loading states don't block other form interactions
