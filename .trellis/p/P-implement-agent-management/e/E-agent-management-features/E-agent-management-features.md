## Purpose and Goals

Implement the core CRUD functionality for agent management, connecting the UI components to the data layer through proper event handlers and state management. This epic delivers the actual user-facing features.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### Create Agent Feature

- Modal for agent creation
- Form submission and validation
- Save to persistence layer
- Update UI immediately

### Edit Agent Feature

- Pre-populate form with existing data
- Handle name uniqueness validation
- Save changes with optimistic updates
- Unsaved changes warning

### Delete Agent Feature

- Confirmation dialog
- Remove from persistence
- Update UI immediately
- Clean up any references

### Defaults Management

- Load and save default settings
- Apply defaults to new agents
- Reset functionality with confirmation
- Settings persistence

### Settings Navigation Integration

- Add "Agents" item to settings navigation menu
- Wire up navigation routing to agents section
- Ensure proper cleanup when leaving section

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Agent Creation Flow

- ✅ "Create New Agent" button opens modal with empty form
- ✅ Form shows all fields with proper initial values
- ✅ Model dropdown populated from LLM configurations
- ✅ Role/Personality dropdowns show available options
- ✅ Name must be unique (validated on submit)
- ✅ Successful creation adds agent to library immediately
- ✅ Success feedback shown to user
- ✅ Modal closes after successful save
- ✅ Error messages displayed for validation failures

### Agent Editing Flow

- ✅ Edit button on agent card opens modal with pre-filled form
- ✅ All current values correctly populated
- ✅ Name uniqueness excludes current agent
- ✅ Model shows even if provider no longer configured
- ✅ Unsaved changes detected and warned on cancel
- ✅ Successful save updates library immediately
- ✅ Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- ✅ Success feedback shown to user

### Agent Deletion Flow

- ✅ Delete button on agent card triggers confirmation
- ✅ Confirmation dialog shows agent name
- ✅ Successful deletion removes from library immediately
- ✅ No orphaned data remains
- ✅ Success feedback shown to user
- ✅ Error handling if deletion fails

### Defaults Management Flow

- ✅ Defaults tab loads current default settings
- ✅ Temperature slider updates preview in real-time
- ✅ Max tokens input validates range (1-4000)
- ✅ Top P slider updates preview in real-time
- ✅ Settings apply to new agent creation
- ✅ Reset button requires confirmation
- ✅ Reset restores factory defaults
- ✅ Settings persist across app restarts

### Modal Behavior

- ✅ Modal prevents interaction with background
- ✅ Escape key closes modal (with unsaved changes check)
- ✅ Click outside closes modal (with unsaved changes check)
- ✅ Focus trapped within modal
- ✅ Proper focus management on open/close

### Settings Navigation Integration

- ✅ "Agents" item added to settings navigation menu
- ✅ Navigation to Agents section works correctly
- ✅ Active state shown in navigation when on Agents section
- ✅ Keyboard navigation supported (arrow keys)
- ✅ State properly cleaned up when leaving section

## Technical Considerations

- Use existing modal patterns from roles/personalities
- Event handlers follow established patterns
- No complex state management beyond Zustand
- Keep business logic in stores, not components
- Simple error handling with user feedback

## Dependencies

- E-data-layer-persistence (for store operations)
- E-ui-components (for UI elements)

## Estimated Scale

- 5 features (create, edit, delete, defaults, navigation)
- Each feature broken into 2-3 focused tasks
- Total: ~12-15 tasks
