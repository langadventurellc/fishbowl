    Successfully implemented Create New Agent button functionality and modal
    state management. The task connected the existing AgentFormModal with the
    useAgentsStore for full persistence, enabling users to create and edit
    agents with proper validation, error handling, and user feedback.


    Key accomplishments:

    - Connected existing Create Agent button in LibraryTab to real agent
    persistence

    - Integrated useAgentsStore.createAgent and updateAgent methods with proper
    error handling  

    - Replaced UI-only save handler with full persistence logic

    - Added comprehensive error handling with screen reader announcements for
    accessibility

    - Ensured proper modal state management (open/close on success/error)

    - Fixed AgentsSection test suite by adding required useAgentsStore mock

    - Validated that new agents persist and appear immediately in the UI

    - All quality checks pass (lint, format, type-check) and all tests pass


    The implementation follows established patterns from roles/personalities
    sections and provides a complete end-to-end agent creation flow. Users can
    now successfully create agents that persist to the backend and appear
    immediately in the library.

## Purpose

Implement the "Create New Agent" button functionality and modal state management to enable users to open the agent creation modal and complete the end-to-end agent creation flow.

## Context

The AgentsSection component needs to have a working "Create New Agent" button that opens the AgentFormModal in create mode. This should follow the patterns established in the roles and personalities sections.

## Implementation Requirements

### Button Implementation

- **Location**: Add "Create New Agent" button to the agents library interface
- **Styling**: Follow existing button patterns from roles/personalities sections
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **State Management**: Button should be enabled/disabled based on app state

### Modal State Management

- **Modal State**: Track open/closed state for the creation modal
- **Mode Management**: Set modal to "create" mode when button is clicked
- **Initial Data**: Pass empty/default form data for new agent creation
- **State Reset**: Clear any previous modal state when opening fresh

### Integration with Store Operations

- **Save Handler**: Connect modal save callback to useAgentsStore.createAgent
- **Success Handling**: Show success notification and refresh UI after creation
- **Error Handling**: Display errors from store operations
- **Optimistic Updates**: Ensure new agent appears immediately in UI

### User Experience Flow

1. User clicks "Create New Agent" button
2. Modal opens with empty form
3. User fills in required fields (name, model, role, personality)
4. User clicks save, agent is created via store
5. Modal closes, success notification shows
6. New agent appears in library list

### Technical Implementation

- **Modal State**: Use React useState or similar for modal open/close
- **Button Handler**: Implement onClick handler to open modal in create mode
- **Store Integration**: Use useAgentsStore createAgent method
- **Error States**: Handle and display any creation errors
- **Loading States**: Show loading indicators during save operation

### Acceptance Criteria

- "Create New Agent" button visible and clickable in agents section
- Button click opens AgentFormModal in create mode with empty form
- Form fields are properly initialized with default values
- Successful agent creation adds agent to library immediately
- Success notification appears after successful creation
- Modal closes automatically after successful save
- Error messages display if agent creation fails
- Button is properly accessible via keyboard navigation

### Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/LibraryTab.tsx` or similar - add create button
- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/AgentsSection.tsx` - modal state management
- May need to modify other components in the agents directory for proper integration

### Testing Requirements

- Test button click opens modal correctly
- Test successful agent creation flow end-to-end
- Test error scenarios (validation failures, save errors)
- Test modal state management (open/close behavior)
- Test accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Test success notifications appear correctly

## Dependencies

- Requires completed AgentFormModal from T-implement-agentformmodal-with
- Requires functioning useAgentsStore createAgent method
- Requires existing UI notification system
