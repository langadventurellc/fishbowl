## Purpose

Replace the placeholder AgentFormModal with a complete implementation that integrates the AgentForm component and handles modal behavior, state management, and user interactions.

## Context

The AgentFormModal component exists at `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/AgentFormModal.tsx` but only contains placeholder content. It needs to follow the same patterns established by RoleFormModal for consistent user experience.

## Implementation Requirements

### Modal Structure and Behavior

- **Modal Content**: Replace placeholder with AgentForm component integration
- **Modal Header**: Use DialogHeader with proper title and description
- **Focus Management**: Implement focus trapping and initial focus
- **Keyboard Handling**: Support Escape key and Ctrl/Cmd+S shortcuts
- **Unsaved Changes Protection**: Warn user before closing with unsaved changes

### Integration with AgentForm

- **Form Submission**: Handle onSave callback from AgentForm
- **Form Cancellation**: Handle onCancel with unsaved changes protection
- **Loading States**: Pass isLoading state to AgentForm during save operations
- **Error Handling**: Display form errors and save errors appropriately

### Modal State Management

- **Mode Support**: Handle "create", "edit", and "template" modes properly
- **Initial Data**: Pass correct initial data based on mode
- **Success Handling**: Close modal after successful save with success feedback
- **Error Handling**: Keep modal open on save errors and display error messages

### Technical Implementation

- Follow RoleFormModal patterns from `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/roles/RoleFormModal.tsx`
- Use useConfirmationDialog hook for unsaved changes warnings
- Use useUnsavedChanges hook for change detection
- Use useFocusTrap hook for accessibility
- Implement proper screen reader announcements

### Acceptance Criteria

- Modal opens with appropriate title based on mode (create/edit/template)
- AgentForm renders properly within modal content area
- Focus traps within modal and restores properly on close
- Escape key closes modal with unsaved changes check
- Ctrl/Cmd+S triggers form submission
- Click outside modal prompts unsaved changes confirmation if needed
- Successful save closes modal and shows success notification
- Save errors keep modal open and display error message
- Modal follows existing design patterns and accessibility standards

### Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/AgentFormModal.tsx` - complete implementation

### Testing Requirements

- Test modal opening and closing behavior
- Test keyboard shortcuts (Escape, Ctrl/Cmd+S)
- Test unsaved changes warnings
- Test focus management and accessibility
- Test error states and success states
- Test all three modes (create, edit, template)

## Dependencies

- Requires completed AgentForm component from T-complete-agentform-field
- Requires existing useConfirmationDialog, useUnsavedChanges, useFocusTrap hooks
