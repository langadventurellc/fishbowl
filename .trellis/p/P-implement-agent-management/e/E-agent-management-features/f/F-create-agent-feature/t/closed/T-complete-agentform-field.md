## Purpose

Complete the AgentForm component by implementing all required form fields with proper validation, styling, and user experience features.

## Context

The AgentForm component exists at `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/AgentForm.tsx` with React Hook Form setup and zodResolver integration, but needs complete field implementations. The component already has the proper form structure and validation schema in place.

## Implementation Requirements

### Form Fields to Implement

- **Name Field**: AgentNameInput component with validation feedback
- **Model Field**: ModelSelect dropdown (already exists, integrate properly)
- **Role Field**: RoleSelect dropdown (already exists, integrate properly)
- **Personality Field**: PersonalitySelect dropdown (already exists, integrate properly)
- **Temperature Slider**: ConfigurationSlider component (0-2 range, step 0.1)
- **Max Tokens Input**: Number input (1-4000 range with validation)
- **Top P Slider**: ConfigurationSlider component (0-1 range, step 0.01)
- **System Prompt Textarea**: Optional field with character counter (max 5000 chars)

### Technical Implementation

- Follow existing form patterns from roles/personalities sections
- Use FormField components with proper control integration
- Implement proper error state styling and messages
- Add loading states for selection components
- Use existing ConfigurationSlider and CharacterCounter components
- Follow agentSchema validation rules exactly

### Acceptance Criteria

- All 8 form fields render correctly with proper labels
- Form validation works for all field types (required, ranges, character limits)
- Error messages display clearly under invalid fields
- Selection dropdowns populate from their respective stores
- Sliders show current values and update smoothly
- Character counter shows remaining characters for system prompt
- Form submission triggers validation and handles success/error states
- Initial data populates correctly when in edit mode
- Unsaved changes detection works properly

### Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/AgentForm.tsx` - complete field implementations
- May need to import ConfigurationSlider and CharacterCounter components

### Testing Requirements

- Verify all fields accept valid input and reject invalid input
- Test form submission with valid and invalid data
- Test edit mode with pre-populated data
- Verify error message display for each validation rule
- Test character counter behavior for system prompt field

## Dependencies

- Requires existing selection components (ModelSelect, RoleSelect, PersonalitySelect)
- Requires ConfigurationSlider component for temperature and topP fields
- Requires CharacterCounter component for system prompt field
