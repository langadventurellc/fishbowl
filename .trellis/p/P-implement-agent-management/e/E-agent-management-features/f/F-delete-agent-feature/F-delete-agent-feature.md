## Purpose

Implement agent deletion functionality with confirmation dialog and proper cleanup.

## Key Components to Implement

- Delete confirmation dialog
- Delete action in store
- IPC handler for deletion
- UI updates after deletion
- Reference cleanup

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Delete Initiation

- **Delete Button**: Delete button on agent card triggers flow
- **Button Styling**: Clear danger/destructive styling
- **Disabled State**: Disable during deletion process
- **Loading State**: Show loading during deletion

### Confirmation Dialog

- **Dialog Display**: Show confirmation before deletion
- **Agent Name**: Display agent name in confirmation message
- **Clear Warning**: Explain deletion is permanent
- **Cancel Option**: Allow canceling deletion
- **Confirm Button**: Require explicit confirmation

### Deletion Process

- **Store Update**: Remove from Zustand store
- **Persistence**: Delete from JSON file storage
- **Immediate Update**: Remove from UI immediately
- **No Orphans**: Clean up any references
- **Success Feedback**: Show success notification
- **Error Handling**: Show error if deletion fails

### UI Updates

- **Library Update**: Remove agent card from library
- **Smooth Animation**: Animate removal if possible
- **Empty State**: Show empty state if last agent
- **Focus Management**: Move focus to appropriate element

### Error Recovery

- **Failed Deletion**: Restore agent if delete fails
- **Error Message**: Show clear error to user
- **Retry Option**: Allow retry of failed deletion
- **State Consistency**: Ensure UI matches actual state

## Technical Requirements

- Implement confirmation dialog component
- Add delete action to useAgentsStore
- Create delete IPC handler
- Handle optimistic deletion with rollback
- Ensure atomic deletion operation

## Implementation Guidance

1. Create DeleteConfirmationDialog component
2. Add delete action to useAgentsStore
3. Implement delete IPC handler
4. Wire up delete button on AgentCard
5. Handle optimistic deletion
6. Add error recovery logic
7. Implement smooth removal animation

## Testing Requirements

- Verify confirmation dialog appears
- Test cancel stops deletion
- Verify successful deletion removes agent
- Test error handling and recovery
- Verify no orphaned data remains
- Test focus management after deletion
- Verify empty state shows correctly

## Security Considerations

- Validate agent ID before deletion
- Prevent deletion of non-existent agents
- Ensure proper authorization (if applicable)
- Log deletion events for audit

## Performance Requirements

- Deletion operation < 500ms
- UI update immediate (optimistic)
- Smooth animations without jank
- No UI freeze during deletion

## Dependencies

- Requires F-create-agent-feature for agent display
- Uses same store and IPC patterns
- Integrates with existing UI components

## Edge Cases

- Handle deletion of currently active agent
- Handle rapid multiple deletions
- Handle deletion during edit
- Handle network/storage failures
