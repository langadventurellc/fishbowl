Perform comprehensive testing of the complete defaults management feature, ensuring all components work together correctly and fixing any integration issues.

## Context

After implementing all individual pieces of the defaults management feature, we need to test the complete end-to-end functionality and resolve any integration issues that arise.

## Testing Scope

### End-to-End User Flows

1. **First Time User Experience**
   - App starts with factory defaults
   - User can see and modify defaults in DefaultsTab
   - New agents automatically use configured defaults

2. **Settings Persistence**
   - Changes in DefaultsTab persist across app restarts
   - Settings load correctly on app startup
   - Auto-save works with proper debouncing

3. **Agent Creation Integration**
   - New agents use current defaults for LLM parameters
   - Editing existing agents preserves their original values
   - Defaults changes reflect in new agent creation immediately

4. **Reset Functionality**
   - Reset button restores factory defaults
   - Reset confirmation works correctly
   - UI updates immediately after reset

### Component Integration Testing

- DefaultsTab ↔ useAgentsStore interaction
- AgentForm ↔ useAgentsStore defaults integration
- IPC communication between renderer and main process
- Persistence layer saving/loading
- Error handling across all components

### Performance Testing

- Auto-save debouncing works correctly (500ms delay)
- No unnecessary re-renders or API calls
- Smooth UI interactions during settings changes
- Proper loading states during persistence operations

## Issues to Watch For

### Common Integration Issues

- Race conditions during app startup
- Store state not syncing with UI components
- Persistence errors not displaying to user
- Form validation conflicts with dynamic defaults
- Memory leaks from event listeners or timers

### Data Consistency Issues

- Defaults changes not reflecting in new agent creation
- Store state getting out of sync with persistence
- Multiple components modifying defaults simultaneously
- Invalid defaults data causing validation errors

### UI/UX Issues

- Loading states not appearing correctly
- Error messages not user-friendly
- Accessibility features broken during integration
- Performance lag during rapid slider movements

## Implementation Requirements

### Integration Testing

- Test complete user workflows from start to finish
- Verify persistence across app restarts
- Test error recovery scenarios
- Validate all component interactions

### Bug Fixes

- Fix any race conditions or timing issues
- Resolve validation conflicts
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Address performance bottlenecks

### Polish and Optimization

- Optimize component re-rendering
- Improve loading state transitions
- Enhance error messaging
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### Documentation Updates

- Update component documentation
- Add integration examples
- Document any architectural decisions
- Update type definitions if needed

## Technical Approach

1. Set up comprehensive test environment
2. Execute all user workflows manually and automated
3. Identify and document any issues found
4. Prioritize and fix critical integration problems
5. Optimize performance and user experience
6. Verify all acceptance criteria are met

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Complete defaults management workflow works end-to-end
- ✅ Settings persist correctly across app restarts
- ✅ New agents automatically use configured defaults
- ✅ DefaultsTab integration with store works flawlessly
- ✅ AgentForm respects defaults for new agents only
- ✅ Reset functionality works correctly
- ✅ All error states handled gracefully
- ✅ Performance meets requirements (debouncing, responsiveness)
- ✅ Accessibility features fully functional
- ✅ All existing functionality remains intact

## Test Cases

### Functional Tests

- [ ] Factory defaults loaded on first app start
- [ ] DefaultsTab controls update store immediately
- [ ] Store changes auto-save after 500ms
- [ ] Settings persist across app restarts
- [ ] New agents use current defaults
- [ ] Editing agents preserves original values
- [ ] Reset restores factory defaults
- [ ] Error states display correctly

### Integration Tests

- [ ] DefaultsTab ↔ Store synchronization
- [ ] AgentForm ↔ Store defaults integration
- [ ] Main ↔ Renderer IPC communication
- [ ] Store ↔ Persistence layer
- [ ] Multi-component state consistency

### Performance Tests

- [ ] Auto-save debouncing (500ms)
- [ ] Slider responsiveness
- [ ] Component render optimization
- [ ] Memory usage stability

## Dependencies

- All previous tasks must be completed and working
- May require updates to shared types or interfaces
- Could need adjustments to existing components

## Files Potentially Affected

- Any integration issues may require updates to implemented components
- Shared types if interfaces need adjustment
- Test files for comprehensive coverage

## Risk Mitigation

- Test early and frequently during implementation
- Have rollback plan for each integration step
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document any breaking changes or limitations
