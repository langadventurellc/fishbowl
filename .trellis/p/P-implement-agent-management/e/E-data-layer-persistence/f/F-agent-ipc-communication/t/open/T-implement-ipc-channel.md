## Context

Implement the foundational IPC infrastructure for agent operations by creating channel constants and type definitions, following the exact pattern from personalitiesHandlers implementation. This establishes the communication contracts between main and renderer processes.

## Implementation Requirements

### IPC Channel Constants

- Add `AGENTS_CHANNELS` object to `apps/desktop/src/shared/ipc/index.ts`
- Include LOAD, SAVE, RESET channel identifiers
- Follow exact pattern from existing `PERSONALITIES_CHANNELS`
- Export through existing IPC barrel file

### IPC Type Definitions

- Create `AgentsLoadResponse` type for load operation results
- Create `AgentsSaveRequest` type for save operation input
- Create `AgentsSaveResponse` type for save operation results
- Create `AgentsResetResponse` type for reset operation results
- All types should follow exact pattern from personalities IPC types
- Place types in appropriate shared IPC types file

## Technical Approach

1. **Examine existing patterns**: Review `PERSONALITIES_CHANNELS` and related types in the shared IPC directory
2. **Create channel constants**: Add `AGENTS_CHANNELS` object with LOAD, SAVE, RESET properties
3. **Define request/response types**: Create type definitions matching the established patterns
4. **Export properly**: Ensure all new types and constants are exported through barrel files

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ `AGENTS_CHANNELS` object exists with proper channel identifiers
- ✅ All four response/request types are properly defined
- ✅ Types follow exact naming and structure patterns from personalities
- ✅ All exports are properly configured in barrel files
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Testing Requirements

- ✅ Unit tests verify channel constant values are correct
- ✅ Unit tests validate type definitions compile properly
- ✅ Unit tests ensure exports are accessible
- ✅ Type-only imports work correctly in test files

## Files to Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/shared/ipc/index.ts` - Add channel constants
- `apps/desktop/src/shared/ipc/types.ts` (or similar) - Add type definitions
- Test files for validation

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundation task for other IPC handlers.

## Security Considerations

- Channel identifiers use safe, predictable naming
- Type definitions prevent data injection
- No sensitive information in type structures
