# Add Agent Modal Component

## Purpose

Create a modal interface component that allows users to select and add existing agents to conversations, following established modal patterns from the codebase (RenameConversationModal, DeleteConversationModal).

## Functionality

Implement a user-friendly modal with agent selection dropdown, proper form validation, loading states, and integration with the conversation agents hook for seamless agent addition.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Modal Component (`apps/desktop/src/components/modals/AddAgentToConversationModal.tsx`)

- Controlled modal with open/onOpenChange props
- Agent selection dropdown populated from useAgentsStore
- Form validation and submission
- Loading states and error handling
- Consistent styling with existing modals

### 2. Agent Selection Interface

- Dropdown/select component with available agents
- Search/filter functionality for large agent lists
- Visual indicators for agent types/roles
- Prevention of duplicate agent selection
- Clear agent display with names and descriptions

### 3. Modal Integration Types

- Props interface following established patterns
- Event handler types for form submission
- Integration with existing component architecture

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Modal Behavior Requirements

- ✅ Modal opens when triggered by parent component
- ✅ Modal closes on successful agent addition
- ✅ Modal closes on user cancellation (X button, Escape key, backdrop click)
- ✅ Focus management - focus returns to trigger element on close
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- ✅ Proper ARIA labels for accessibility

### Agent Selection Requirements

- ✅ Dropdown populated with all configured agents from useAgentsStore
- ✅ Agents already in conversation are filtered out or disabled
- ✅ Agent display includes name, role, and personality information
- ✅ Search/filter functionality for easy agent discovery
- ✅ No duplicate agent selection possible
- ✅ Clear visual indication of selected agent

### Form Validation Requirements

- ✅ Required field validation (agent must be selected)
- ✅ Duplicate prevention at form level
- ✅ Real-time validation feedback
- ✅ Submit button disabled until valid selection made
- ✅ Error messages displayed inline with form

### Loading and Error States

- ✅ Loading spinner during agent addition operation
- ✅ Submit button disabled during submission
- ✅ Error messages displayed for failed operations
- ✅ Success feedback with automatic modal close
- ✅ Form reset after successful submission

### Visual Design Requirements

- ✅ Consistent with existing modal styling (shadcn/ui Dialog)
- ✅ Proper spacing and typography following design system
- ✅ Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
- ✅ Loading states with appropriate visual indicators
- ✅ Error states with clear visual differentiation

## Implementation Guidance

### Modal Structure Pattern

```typescript
interface AddAgentToConversationModalProps {
  open: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void;
  conversationId: string;
  onAgentAdded?: () => void;
}

export function AddAgentToConversationModal({
  open,
  onOpenChange,
  conversationId,
  onAgentAdded
}: AddAgentToConversationModalProps) {
  const { agents } = useAgentsStore();
  const { conversationAgents, addAgent } = useConversationAgents(conversationId);

  // Form state and handlers
  // Agent selection logic
  // Submit handling with error management

  return (
    <Dialog open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange}>
      <DialogContent>
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>Add Agent to Conversation</DialogTitle>
        </DialogHeader>

        {/* Agent selection form */}

        <DialogFooter>
          <Button variant=\"outline\" onClick={() => onOpenChange(false)}>
            Cancel
          </Button>
          <Button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={!selectedAgent || isSubmitting}>
            {isSubmitting ? \"Adding...\" : \"Add Agent\"}
          </Button>
        </DialogFooter>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```

### Agent Selection Logic

- Filter out agents already in the conversation
- Sort agents by name for easy discovery
- Include agent metadata (role, personality) in display
- Handle edge cases (no available agents, loading states)

### Form Handling Patterns

- Controlled form state using useState
- Real-time validation with immediate feedback
- Async submission with proper error handling
- Form reset after successful operations

## Testing Requirements

- ✅ Modal opening and closing behavior
- ✅ Agent selection and form validation
- ✅ Submit handling with success/error scenarios
- ✅ Keyboard navigation and accessibility
- ✅ Loading states and visual feedback
- ✅ Integration with conversation agents hook

## Accessibility Requirements

- ✅ Proper ARIA roles and labels
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Focus management (focus trap while open)
- ✅ Screen reader compatible
- ✅ High contrast mode support
- ✅ Reduced motion respect

## Performance Requirements

- ✅ Efficient rendering with proper memoization
- ✅ Minimal re-renders during typing/selection
- ✅ Fast modal opening/closing animations
- ✅ Responsive agent list handling for large datasets

## Dependencies

- Conversation Agents Hook and State Management (prerequisite)
- Existing `useAgentsStore` hook
- shadcn/ui Dialog components
- Existing modal component patterns
- Form validation utilities
