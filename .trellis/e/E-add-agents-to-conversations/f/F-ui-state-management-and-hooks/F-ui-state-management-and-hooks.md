# UI State Management and Hooks

## Purpose

Create React hooks and state management infrastructure for managing conversation agents in the UI layer, including data fetching, mutations, and state synchronization.

## Key Components to Implement

- `useConversationAgents` custom hook
- View model types for UI layer
- State synchronization with refetch pattern
- Loading and error state management
- Integration with existing agent store

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Hook Implementation Requirements

✅ **useConversationAgents Hook**

- Hook accepts `conversationId: string | null` parameter
- Returns object with: `conversationAgents`, `isLoading`, `error`, `addAgent`, `removeAgent`, `refetch`
- Fetches agents when conversationId changes
- Clears state when conversationId is null
- Implements proper cleanup on unmount
- Uses IPC API for all database operations
- Follows existing hook patterns (useConversations, useUpdateConversation)

✅ **State Management**

- Local state for conversation agents array
- Loading state during fetch operations
- Error state with proper error types
- Automatic refetch after mutations
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Proper memoization of callbacks

✅ **Data Operations**

- `addAgent(agentId)` - adds agent and refetches
- `removeAgent(agentId)` - removes agent and refetches
- `refetch()` - manual refresh of agent list
- All operations handle errors gracefully
- Loading states during mutations
- Optimistic updates optional (not required initially)

✅ **Type Definitions**

- `ConversationAgentViewModel` in ui-shared package
- Extends base ConversationAgent with populated agent data
- `UseConversationAgentsResult` interface for hook return
- Proper TypeScript types for all operations
- JSDoc comments for public APIs

✅ **Integration Points**

- Works with existing `useAgentsStore` for agent list
- Compatible with IPC conversationAgent API
- Follows existing error handling patterns
- Integrates with existing logging

## Technical Requirements

- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- Follow existing hook patterns in codebase
- Proper dependency arrays in hooks
- Error boundaries compatibility
- No direct database access
- All operations through IPC layer

## Implementation Guidance

1. Create ConversationAgentViewModel type in ui-shared
2. Implement useConversationAgents hook with state management
3. Add IPC calls for data fetching and mutations
4. Implement refetch pattern after mutations
5. Add proper error handling and loading states
6. Export from hooks barrel file

## Testing Requirements

- Hook fetches agents when conversationId changes
- State clears when conversationId becomes null
- Add/remove operations trigger refetch
- Loading states display during operations
- Errors are captured and surfaced properly
- Memory leaks prevented with cleanup

## Dependencies

- F-service-layer-and-ipc (requires IPC handlers to be in place)
