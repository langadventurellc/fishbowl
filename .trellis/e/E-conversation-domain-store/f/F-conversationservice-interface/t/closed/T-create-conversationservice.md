title: Create ConversationService interface file structure and imports
status: done
priority: high
parent: F-conversationservice-interface
prerequisites: []
affectedFiles:
  packages/shared/src/services/conversations/ConversationService.ts:
    Created main interface file with type-only imports of Conversation, Message,
    ConversationAgent, and CreateMessageInput from existing shared package
    locations. Includes comprehensive TypeDoc documentation explaining Platform
    Abstraction Pattern and empty interface structure ready for method
    implementations in subsequent tasks.
  packages/shared/src/services/conversations/index.ts:
    Created barrel export file
    providing clean import path for ConversationService interface following
    established shared package patterns.
  packages/shared/src/services/conversations/__tests__/ConversationService.test.ts:
    "Created comprehensive test suite with 3 tests: interface type validation,
    import resolution verification, and barrel export confirmation. All tests
    pass and verify TypeScript compilation works correctly."
log:
  - Successfully implemented ConversationService interface file structure with
    all required type imports and comprehensive testing. Created the
    foundational abstraction layer in
    packages/shared/src/services/conversations/ that will eliminate direct
    window.electronAPI calls from UI components. Interface follows Platform
    Abstraction Pattern with proper TypeDoc documentation, type-only imports
    from existing @fishbowl-ai/shared locations, and includes compilation
    validation tests. All quality checks pass and tests verify proper TypeScript
    compilation and import resolution.

## Purpose

Set up the foundational file structure for the ConversationService interface in the shared package, including proper imports of existing domain types and establishing the base interface structure.

## Context

This task establishes the ConversationService interface as defined in feature F-conversationservice-interface. The interface must exactly match the current window.electronAPI surface to enable clean platform abstraction for the conversation domain store architecture (epic E-conversation-domain-store).

## Implementation Requirements

### File Creation and Structure

Create the main interface file:

- **Location**: `packages/shared/src/services/conversations/ConversationService.ts`
- **Purpose**: Clean abstraction layer that eliminates direct window.electronAPI calls from UI components

### Type Import Configuration

Import all required domain types from existing locations (DO NOT redefine any types):

```typescript
import type {
  Conversation,
  Message,
  ConversationAgent,
  CreateMessageInput, // Import from existing @fishbowl-ai/shared location
} from "@fishbowl-ai/shared";
```

**Critical**: Use existing CreateMessageInput type from `packages/shared/src/types/messages/CreateMessageInput.ts` - verified to exist in codebase analysis.

### Base Interface Structure

Establish the interface declaration with TypeDoc documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * Platform-agnostic service interface for conversation operations
 *
 * Provides clean abstraction over platform-specific IPC calls, enabling
 * the conversation domain store to work independently of window.electronAPI.
 *
 * Method signatures exactly match current IPC surface for seamless integration.
 * All methods throw errors (no ErrorState at interface level).
 */
export interface ConversationService {
  // Interface methods will be added in subsequent tasks
}
```

### Directory Structure Setup

Ensure proper directory structure exists:

- Create `packages/shared/src/services/conversations/` directory if needed
- Interface will be the first file in this new service module

## Technical Specifications

### Import Strategy

- **Reuse all existing types**: Never redefine Message, Conversation, ConversationAgent, or CreateMessageInput
- **Import from @fishbowl-ai/shared**: Use package imports, not relative paths
- **Type-only imports**: Use `import type {}` for clean interface-only dependencies

### Error Handling Approach

- **Interface level**: Methods throw standard Error objects
- **No ErrorState**: Interface should not depend on platform-specific error patterns
- **Clean abstraction**: Platform adapters will convert errors to appropriate formats

### Documentation Standards

- **TypeDoc comments**: Full interface and future method documentation
- **Purpose clarity**: Explain platform abstraction role
- **IPC alignment note**: Document exact matching with window.electronAPI

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] ConversationService.ts file created at correct location
- [ ] All domain types properly imported from existing @fishbowl-ai/shared locations
- [ ] CreateMessageInput imported correctly (not redefined)
- [ ] Interface declaration established with proper documentation
- [ ] Directory structure properly established

### Code Quality

- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] No platform-specific dependencies in imports
- [ ] Clean type-only imports used appropriately
- [ ] Proper TypeDoc documentation format

### Integration Requirements

- [ ] File location matches feature specification exactly
- [ ] Import paths compatible with existing package structure
- [ ] Ready for method implementations in subsequent tasks
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing type exports

## Dependencies and Sequencing

### Prerequisites

- None (foundational task)

### Enables

- Conversation operations implementation
- Message operations implementation
- ConversationAgent operations implementation
- Chat orchestration implementation

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing (included in this task)

- [ ] TypeScript compilation verification
- [ ] Import statement validation
- [ ] Interface declaration syntax check
- [ ] Documentation format verification

Create test file: `packages/shared/src/services/conversations/__tests__/ConversationService.test.ts`

```typescript
import type { ConversationService } from "../ConversationService";

describe("ConversationService Interface", () => {
  it("should be properly typed interface", () => {
    // Compilation test - if this compiles, interface is valid
    const mockService: Partial<ConversationService> = {};
    expect(typeof mockService).toBe("object");
  });

  it("should import all required types without errors", async () => {
    // Dynamic import test to verify all dependencies resolve
    const module = await import("../ConversationService");
    expect(typeof module).toBe("object");
  });
});
```

## Out of Scope

- Method implementations (handled by subsequent tasks)
- Platform-specific adapter code (different feature)
- Domain store integration (different feature)
- IPC layer modifications (different feature)

## Security Considerations

- Interface should not expose internal implementation details
- Type definitions should prevent invalid data structures
- Method signatures should enable proper validation at implementation level

## Files Created

- `packages/shared/src/services/conversations/ConversationService.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/services/conversations/__tests__/ConversationService.test.ts`

This task provides the foundation for all subsequent ConversationService implementation tasks.
