  packages/shared/src/services/index.ts: Added export for conversations service

log:
  - Successfully implemented barrel exports and integration for
    ConversationService interface. The service is now properly exported through
    barrel files and integrated with the main services package, enabling clean
    import paths throughout the monorepo. Created comprehensive documentation
    explaining the service's purpose and usage patterns. All quality checks pass
    and the interface is ready for consumption by platform adapters and domain
    stores.

## Purpose

Set up proper barrel exports and integration points for the ConversationService interface, ensuring it's accessible throughout the shared package and ready for platform adapter implementations and domain store integration.

## Context

This task completes the ConversationService interface implementation by establishing proper export patterns and integration points. The interface must be easily importable by platform adapters, domain stores, and other consumers throughout the monorepo.

This follows the established patterns in the shared package where services are exported through barrel files for clean import paths and maintainable organization.

## Implementation Requirements

### Primary Barrel Export

Create the conversations service barrel export:

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/services/conversations/index.ts

/**
 * Conversation service interfaces and types
 *
 * Provides platform-agnostic conversation, message, and agent operations
 * for use by domain stores and platform adapters.
 */

export type { ConversationService } from "./ConversationService";

// Future exports when implementations are added:
// export { ConversationServiceImplementation } from './ConversationServiceImplementation';
// export type { ConversationServiceConfig } from './types';
```

### Services Package Integration

Update the main services barrel export:

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/services/index.ts

// ... existing service exports ...

// Conversation services
export type { ConversationService } from "./conversations";
```

### Main Package Integration

Verify/update the main shared package index if needed:

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/index.ts

// ... existing exports ...

// Services (should already include services/index.ts exports)
export * from "./services";
```

### Import Path Verification

Ensure the following import patterns work correctly after integration:

1. **Direct service import**: `import { ConversationService } from '@fishbowl-ai/shared'`
2. **Service namespace import**: `import { ConversationService } from '@fishbowl-ai/shared/services'`
3. **Specific service import**: `import { ConversationService } from '@fishbowl-ai/shared/services/conversations'`

## Technical Specifications

### Export Strategy

- **Type-only exports**: Use `export type {}` for interface exports to prevent runtime overhead
- **Barrel pattern**: Follow existing shared package barrel export patterns
- **Clean namespacing**: Maintain clear separation between interface and future implementations

### Integration Verification

- **Platform adapters**: Interface must be importable in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/`
- **Domain stores**: Interface must be importable in `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/`
- **Type resolution**: TypeScript must resolve imports without circular dependencies

### Documentation Integration

Add service documentation to the conversations directory:

````typescript
// packages/shared/src/services/conversations/README.md

# Conversation Services

Platform-agnostic conversation, message, and agent operations.

## ConversationService Interface

The `ConversationService` interface provides clean abstraction over platform-specific conversation operations, enabling the domain store architecture to work independently of platform IPC calls.

### Usage

```typescript
import { ConversationService } from '@fishbowl-ai/shared';

// Use in domain store or platform adapter
class MyService {
  constructor(private conversationService: ConversationService) {}
}
````

### Operations

- **Conversations**: CRUD operations for conversation management
- **Messages**: Create, list, delete operations (no pagination complexity)
- **Agents**: Full lifecycle management within conversations
- **Orchestration**: Agent response triggering

See `ConversationService.ts` for complete API documentation.

````

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Barrel export created in conversations service directory
- [ ] Services index updated to include conversation exports
- [ ] Main package index includes conversation service exports (if needed)
- [ ] All three import patterns work correctly from other packages
- [ ] Documentation README created for service directory

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors across all packages
- [ ] No circular import dependencies introduced
- [ ] Export patterns follow existing shared package conventions
- [ ] Type-only exports used appropriately for interfaces

### Integration Verification
- [ ] Interface importable from desktop renderer services directory
- [ ] Interface importable from ui-shared stores directory
- [ ] Interface importable from other shared package modules
- [ ] Import paths resolve correctly in TypeScript
- [ ] No runtime bundle bloat from interface exports

## Dependencies and Sequencing

### Prerequisites
- T-create-conversationservice: Base interface file must exist
- T-implement-conversation: Conversation operations must be complete
- T-implement-message-operations: Message operations must be complete
- T-implement-conversation-agent: Agent operations must be complete
- T-implement-chat-orchestration: Chat operations must be complete

### Enables
- Desktop IPC adapter implementation (feature F-desktop-ipc-adapter)
- Domain store implementation (feature F-conversation-domain-store)
- End-to-end integration testing (feature F-end-to-end-wiring-validation)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing (included in this task)

Create integration test to verify exports work correctly:

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/services/conversations/__tests__/integration.test.ts

describe('ConversationService Integration', () => {
  it('should export ConversationService from conversations barrel', async () => {
    const { ConversationService } = await import('../index');
    expect(ConversationService).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should export ConversationService from services barrel', async () => {
    const servicesModule = await import('../../index');
    expect(servicesModule.ConversationService).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should export ConversationService from main package', async () => {
    const sharedModule = await import('../../../index');
    expect(sharedModule.ConversationService).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should support all expected import patterns', async () => {
    // Test different import approaches
    const direct = await import('@fishbowl-ai/shared');
    const services = await import('@fishbowl-ai/shared/services');
    const conversations = await import('@fishbowl-ai/shared/services/conversations');

    expect(direct.ConversationService).toBeDefined();
    expect(services.ConversationService).toBeDefined();
    expect(conversations.ConversationService).toBeDefined();
  });
});
````

### Build Verification

Run build verification to ensure exports work across package boundaries:

```bash
# Verify shared package builds with new exports
pnpm build:libs

# Verify TypeScript compilation in dependent packages
pnpm type-check
```

## Out of Scope

- Platform adapter implementations (separate feature)
- Domain store implementations (separate feature)
- Service configuration types (added when implementations are created)
- Service factory patterns (added when needed)

## Security Considerations

- Type-only exports prevent accidental runtime dependencies
- Clean export patterns prevent internal implementation exposure
- Interface-only exports maintain platform abstraction boundaries

## Performance Considerations

- Type-only exports minimize runtime bundle impact
- Barrel exports enable efficient tree shaking
- Clean import paths reduce bundler complexity

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/shared/src/services/conversations/index.ts` - New barrel export file
- `packages/shared/src/services/conversations/README.md` - New service documentation
- `packages/shared/src/services/conversations/__tests__/integration.test.ts` - New integration test
- `packages/shared/src/services/index.ts` - Updated to include conversation exports
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts` - Verified to include services exports

This task completes the ConversationService interface implementation and makes it ready for consumption by platform adapters and domain stores throughout the monorepo architecture.
