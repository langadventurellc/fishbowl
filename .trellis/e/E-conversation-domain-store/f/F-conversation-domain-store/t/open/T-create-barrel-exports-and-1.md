## Context

Create the barrel export file for the conversation store module following established codebase patterns. This provides clean import paths and encapsulates the store implementation.

## Implementation Requirements

**File to create**: `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/index.ts`

**Exports to Include**:

1. **Main Store Export**:

   ```typescript
   export { useConversationStore } from "./useConversationStore";
   ```

2. **Type Exports**:

   ```typescript
   export type {
     ConversationStore,
     ConversationStoreState,
     ConversationStoreActions,
   } from "./types";
   ```

3. **Selector Exports**:
   ```typescript
   export {
     selectActiveConversationId,
     selectConversations,
     selectActiveMessages,
     selectActiveConversationAgents,
     selectActiveConversation,
     selectHasActiveConversation,
     selectEnabledAgents,
     // ... other selectors
   } from "./selectors";
   ```

**Update Main Store Index**:

**File to update**: `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/index.ts`

Add conversation store to main barrel exports:

```typescript
export * from "./conversation";
```

**Technical Approach**:

- Follow existing store export patterns from other stores in codebase
- Provide both individual exports and wildcard exports as appropriate
- Ensure clean import paths: `import { useConversationStore } from '@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared'`
- Maintain consistency with existing store organization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Barrel export file exports all necessary store components
- [ ] Main store index includes conversation store exports
- [ ] Clean import paths work from external packages
- [ ] Export structure follows existing store patterns
- [ ] TypeScript compilation works without errors
- [ ] All exports resolve correctly in consuming code

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Basic import resolution test for main store
- [ ] Verify type exports resolve correctly
- [ ] Test selector exports work as expected
- [ ] Validate barrel export structure matches specification

## Dependencies

- Requires completed conversation store implementation
- Requires selectors implementation
- Requires types implementation

## Out of Scope

- Complex re-export configurations
- Documentation generation (handled separately)
