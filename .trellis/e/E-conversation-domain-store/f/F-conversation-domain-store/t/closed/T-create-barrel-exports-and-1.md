    barrel export file at packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/index.ts
    already exports all required components: main store hook
    (useConversationStore), all type exports (ConversationStore,
    ConversationStoreState, ConversationStoreActions), and all selectors via
    wildcard export. Main stores index already includes conversation store
    exports. All quality checks pass and import resolution works correctly from
    consuming applications."

## Context

Create the barrel export file for the conversation store module following established codebase patterns. This provides clean import paths and encapsulates the store implementation.

## Implementation Requirements

**File to create**: `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/index.ts`

**Exports to Include**:

1. **Main Store Export**:

   ```typescript
   export { useConversationStore } from "./useConversationStore";
   ```

2. **Type Exports**:

   ```typescript
   export type {
     ConversationStore,
     ConversationStoreState,
     ConversationStoreActions,
   } from "./types";
   ```

3. **Selector Exports**:
   ```typescript
   export {
     selectActiveConversationId,
     selectConversations,
     selectActiveMessages,
     selectActiveConversationAgents,
     selectActiveConversation,
     selectHasActiveConversation,
     selectEnabledAgents,
     // ... other selectors
   } from "./selectors";
   ```

**Update Main Store Index**:

**File to update**: `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/index.ts`

Add conversation store to main barrel exports:

```typescript
export * from "./conversation";
```

**Technical Approach**:

- Follow existing store export patterns from other stores in codebase
- Provide both individual exports and wildcard exports as appropriate
- Ensure clean import paths: `import { useConversationStore } from '@fishbowl-ai/ui-shared'`
- Maintain consistency with existing store organization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Barrel export file exports all necessary store components
- [ ] Main store index includes conversation store exports
- [ ] Clean import paths work from external packages
- [ ] Export structure follows existing store patterns
- [ ] TypeScript compilation works without errors
- [ ] All exports resolve correctly in consuming code

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Basic import resolution test for main store
- [ ] Verify type exports resolve correctly
- [ ] Test selector exports work as expected
- [ ] Validate barrel export structure matches specification

## Dependencies

- Requires completed conversation store implementation
- Requires selectors implementation
- Requires types implementation

## Out of Scope

- Complex re-export configurations
- Documentation generation (handled separately)
