log:
  - Task was already complete upon analysis. The preload type definitions
    already correctly support the enhanced AgentUpdateEvent interface with
    conversationId field. The preload.ts file imports and uses the
    AgentUpdateEvent type generically, so when the interface was enhanced with
    the conversationId field, TypeScript automatically enforced the new field
    requirement. All test mock objects in preload.chat.test.ts already include
    the conversationId field. No code changes were required as the
    implementation was already type-safe and complete.

## Purpose

Update preload type definitions and event handling to support the enhanced AgentUpdateEvent interface with conversationId field, ensuring type safety across the IPC boundary between main and renderer processes.

## Context

The preload script at `apps/desktop/src/electron/preload.ts` handles IPC event registration and provides type-safe APIs to the renderer process. With the enhanced AgentUpdateEvent interface, the preload layer needs to properly type the event callbacks and ensure the conversationId field is available to renderer consumers.

## Implementation Requirements

### Files to Update

1. **Main preload file**: `apps/desktop/src/electron/preload.ts`
   - Lines around 1004-1030 contain the `onAgentUpdate` method implementation
   - Import statement at line 20 already imports AgentUpdateEvent type

2. **Test file**: `apps/desktop/src/electron/__tests__/preload.chat.test.ts`
   - Lines 44-58 contain mock AgentUpdateEvent objects
   - Various test cases that create mock events need conversationId

### Specific Changes

#### 1. Preload Implementation (`preload.ts`)

The current implementation should already work correctly since:

- It imports the AgentUpdateEvent type (line 20)
- Uses generic TypeScript event handling in `onAgentUpdate` (lines 1004-1030)
- TypeScript will automatically enforce the new conversationId field

**Verification needed**: Ensure no explicit type casting or hardcoded structures need updates.

#### 2. Test Updates (`preload.chat.test.ts`)

Update mock event objects to include conversationId:

```typescript
const mockAgentUpdateEvent: AgentUpdateEvent = {
  conversationId: "test-conversation-id", // ADD THIS LINE
  conversationAgentId: "test-agent-id",
  status: "thinking",
  // ... existing fields
};

const mockAgentCompleteEvent: AgentUpdateEvent = {
  conversationId: "test-conversation-id", // ADD THIS LINE
  conversationAgentId: "test-agent-id",
  status: "complete",
  messageId: "test-message-id",
};

const mockAgentErrorEvent: AgentUpdateEvent = {
  conversationId: "test-conversation-id", // ADD THIS LINE
  conversationAgentId: "test-agent-id",
  status: "error",
  error: "Test error message",
  errorType: "network",
  retryable: true,
};
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AgentUpdateEvent type definition automatically includes conversationId field (via import)
- [ ] `onAgentUpdate` callback receives events with conversationId field
- [ ] Type safety maintained across IPC boundary
- [ ] All test mock objects include conversationId field
- [ ] Tests continue to pass with enhanced event structure
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing event handling patterns

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] All existing preload chat tests pass with enhanced AgentUpdateEvent
- [ ] Mock event objects include required conversationId field
- [ ] Type checking validates conversationId field is provided
- [ ] Event callback signatures remain compatible

## Technical Notes

- The AgentUpdateEvent type is imported from shared IPC types, so interface changes are automatically reflected
- No changes to core event handling logic needed - TypeScript handles type enforcement
- Focus on updating test mocks and verifying type compatibility

## Out of Scope

- Changes to event emission (handled in separate task)
- Renderer process event consumption updates (handled in separate task)
- IPC channel definitions (unchanged)

## Dependencies

- Requires: T-add-conversationid-field-to (AgentUpdateEvent interface must be enhanced first)
