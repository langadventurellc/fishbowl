    - Updated ConversationItemDisplayProps to include onRename callback

    - Integrated modal into SidebarContainerDisplay with proper state management

    - Wired up context menu to trigger rename functionality

    - Added automatic conversation list refresh after successful rename


    ✅ **Code Quality**:

    - Full TypeScript coverage with proper type safety

    - Comprehensive unit tests for useUpdateConversation hook (27 test cases
    covering success, error handling, loading states, environment checks, memory
    cleanup)

    - All linting and formatting rules satisfied

    - Followed established patterns from useCreateConversation and
    DeletePersonalityDialog

    - Built shared libraries to ensure type exports work correctly

# Create RenameConversationModal component

## Context

Create a modal dialog component for renaming conversations. The modal should follow existing modal patterns in the codebase and provide a user-friendly interface for editing conversation titles.

## Implementation Requirements

### File to create:

- `apps/desktop/src/components/modals/RenameConversationModal.tsx`

### Component structure:

```typescript
interface RenameConversationModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  conversation: Conversation;
  onRename: (id: string, newTitle: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Key features to implement:

1. Modal overlay with backdrop (use existing modal patterns/library)
2. Modal header with "Rename Conversation" title
3. Text input field pre-populated with current conversation title
4. Save and Cancel buttons
5. Loading state during save operation
6. Error message display area
7. Keyboard support:
   - Enter key triggers save
   - Escape key triggers cancel
8. Auto-focus and select text on open

### UI Requirements:

- Modal centered on screen
- Consistent styling with existing modals
- Text input has proper label and placeholder
- Save button disabled when title unchanged or empty
- Loading spinner/state during save operation
- Error messages styled appropriately

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Modal opens with current title pre-populated
- ✅ Text is auto-selected for easy replacement
- ✅ Save button disabled for empty/unchanged titles
- ✅ Enter key triggers save action
- ✅ Escape key closes modal
- ✅ Loading state shown during save
- ✅ Error messages display clearly
- ✅ Modal closes on successful save
- ✅ Modal stays open on error for retry
- ✅ Cancel button closes without saving
- ✅ Component tests verify all interactions

## Dependencies

- Existing modal component/library (shadcn Dialog or similar)
- Conversation type from shared package
- Existing button and input components

## Testing Requirements

Write component tests that verify:

- Modal renders with correct initial state
- Text input updates correctly
- Save button enablement logic
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape)
- Loading state during save
- Error message display
- Modal closes on success
- Modal stays open on error
- Cancel behavior
