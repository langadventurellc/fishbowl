title: Conversation Rename and Delete Functionality
status: in-progress
priority: medium
prerequisites: []
affectedFiles:
  apps/desktop/src/electron/conversationsHandlers.ts: Added DELETE IPC handler
    with proper error handling, logging, and response formatting following
    CREATE/LIST/GET patterns; Added UPDATE IPC handler following the existing
    CREATE/LIST/GET/DELETE pattern. Imports ConversationsUpdateRequest and
    ConversationsUpdateResponse types, registers handler for
    CONVERSATION_CHANNELS.UPDATE channel, calls conversationsRepository.update()
    with request.id and request.updates, returns success response with updated
    conversation data, and handles errors with logger.error and serializeError.
  apps/desktop/src/electron/__tests__/conversationsHandlers.test.ts:
    Created comprehensive test suite for all conversation handlers including the
    new DELETE handler with success, error, and edge case scenarios; Added
    comprehensive unit tests for UPDATE handler including successful update
    scenario, ConversationNotFoundError handling, database error handling, and
    updated handler registration test to verify UPDATE handler is properly
    registered. All tests follow existing patterns and verify proper repository
    method calls, response formats, and error serialization.
  apps/desktop/src/electron/preload.ts: Added ConversationsDeleteRequest and
    ConversationsDeleteResponse imports and implemented the delete method in the
    conversations API following existing patterns with proper error handling and
    TypeScript types; Added update method to electronAPI.conversations object
    following existing create/list/get/delete patterns. Imported
    ConversationsUpdateRequest, ConversationsUpdateResponse, and
    UpdateConversationInput types. Method properly invokes
    CONVERSATION_CHANNELS.UPDATE with correct parameters, handles success/error
    responses, and includes comprehensive error logging.
  apps/desktop/src/electron/__tests__/preload.conversations.test.ts:
    Added comprehensive unit tests for the delete method including
    success/failure scenarios, error handling, IPC communication errors,
    contextBridge integration, and error logging verification; Added
    comprehensive unit tests for conversations.update method including
    successful update scenario, error response handling, IPC communication error
    handling, contextBridge integration verification, and error logging tests.
    Updated contextBridge integration tests to verify update method is properly
    exposed. All 38 tests passing including new update method coverage.

# Conversation Rename and Delete Functionality

## Purpose and Goals

Implement fully functional rename and delete operations for conversations in the sidebar, completing the existing UI framework that currently shows placeholder actions in the dropdown menu.

## Major Components and Deliverables

### 1. IPC Handler Implementation

- Implement UPDATE and DELETE IPC handlers in `apps/desktop/src/electron/conversationsHandlers.ts`
- Add proper error handling and logging following existing CREATE/LIST patterns
- Integrate with existing ConversationsRepository methods (already implemented)

### 2. Frontend Hook Development

- Create `useUpdateConversation` hook following `useCreateConversation` pattern
- Create `useDeleteConversation` hook following `useCreateConversation` pattern
- Include loading states, error handling, and reactive interfaces
- Integrate with IPC communication layer via electronAPI

### 3. UI Integration

- Replace placeholder functions in ConversationItemDisplay component
- Implement rename functionality with inline editing or modal dialog
- Implement delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- Handle loading and error states in UI components

### 4. IPC Type Definitions

- Add missing request/response types for UPDATE and DELETE operations
- Ensure consistent typing across IPC boundary
- Add preload API exposure for new operations

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Deliverables

- ✅ Users can rename conversations via context menu → inline edit or modal dialog
- ✅ Users can delete conversations via context menu → confirmation dialog
- ✅ Rename updates conversation title in database and refreshes UI immediately
- ✅ Delete removes conversation permanently from database and UI
- ✅ Both operations show loading states during async operations
- ✅ Error handling displays user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Success states provide visual feedback to users

### Integration Requirements

- ✅ Follows existing patterns established by `useCreateConversation` hook
- ✅ Uses existing IPC channel structure (UPDATE/DELETE channels already defined)
- ✅ Integrates with existing ConversationsRepository methods
- ✅ Maintains consistency with existing UI component patterns
- ✅ Uses existing error serialization and logging patterns

### Performance and Quality Standards

- ✅ Operations complete instantly (local SQLite is fast)
- ✅ UI remains responsive during operations
- ✅ No memory leaks from event listeners or state management
- ✅ Proper cleanup of resources in hook implementations

### Security and Compliance Requirements

- ✅ Delete operations are hard deletes (not soft delete) as requested
- ✅ Proper validation of conversation IDs before operations
- ✅ Error handling prevents information disclosure
- ✅ IPC operations validated against malicious input

### User Experience and Usability Criteria

- ✅ Rename: Click → edit inline OR modal → save/cancel actions
- ✅ Delete: Click → confirmation dialog → confirm/cancel actions
- ✅ Clear loading indicators during operations
- ✅ Success feedback (visual confirmation)
- ✅ Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support (Enter/Escape handling)

### Testing and Validation Requirements

- ✅ Unit tests for new hooks following existing test patterns
- ✅ Integration tests for IPC handlers
- ✅ Error path testing (validation errors, database errors)
- ✅ Edge case testing (empty names, special characters)

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Alignment

- Leverages existing repository layer (no new database code needed)
- Uses established IPC patterns and channel definitions
- Follows dependency injection pattern with useServices hook
- Maintains clean separation between UI and business logic

### Development Dependencies

- Repository methods: `ConversationsRepository.update()` and `delete()` ✅ (already implemented)
- IPC channels: `CONVERSATION_CHANNELS.UPDATE` and `DELETE` ✅ (already defined)
- Type definitions: `UpdateConversationInput` ✅ (already implemented)
- UI framework: Context menu structure ✅ (already implemented)

### Risk Mitigation

- Hard delete operations cannot be undone → implement confirmation dialogs
- Database errors (rare with SQLite) → simple error handling with user-friendly messages

## User Stories

### Primary User Scenarios

1. **As a user, I want to rename a conversation** so that I can organize my chats with meaningful titles
   - Given I have a conversation in the sidebar
   - When I click the context menu and select "Rename conversation"
   - Then I can edit the title and save the changes
   - And the new title appears immediately in the sidebar

2. **As a user, I want to delete a conversation** so that I can remove conversations I no longer need
   - Given I have a conversation in the sidebar
   - When I click the context menu and select "Delete conversation"
   - Then I see a confirmation dialog asking if I'm sure
   - When I confirm deletion
   - Then the conversation is permanently removed from the sidebar and database

### Error Handling Scenarios

3. **As a user, I want clear feedback when operations fail** so that I understand what went wrong
   - Given a rename or delete operation fails (e.g., validation error)
   - When the error occurs
   - Then I see a user-friendly error message explaining the problem

## Non-functional Requirements

### Performance

- Local SQLite operations are essentially instant
- UI responsiveness maintained during operations

### Scalability

- Solution works efficiently with 100+ conversations in sidebar

### Maintainability

- Code follows established patterns and conventions
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Clean separation of concerns between layers

## Dependencies on Other Work

- None - all required infrastructure already exists in codebase

## Estimated Scale

- **Features**: 2-3 features (Rename UI/Logic, Delete UI/Logic, Error Handling)
- **Tasks**: 8-12 atomic tasks (1-2 hours each)
- **Total Effort**: 12-20 hours estimated

## Implementation Priority

High - core functionality needed to complete existing UI framework and provide essential user operations for conversation management.
