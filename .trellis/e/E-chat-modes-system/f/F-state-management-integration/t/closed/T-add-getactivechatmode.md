affectedFiles:
  packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/ConversationStoreActions.ts:
    Added getActiveChatMode method signature to interface with proper JSDoc
    documentation specifying return type and reactive behavior
  packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/useConversationStore.ts:
    Implemented getActiveChatMode function that derives chat mode from active
    conversation using efficient array.find operation with null safety via
    optional chaining
  packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/__tests__/getActiveChatMode.test.ts:
    Created comprehensive unit test suite with 20+ test cases covering basic
    functionality, reactive behavior, performance requirements (<1ms), type
    safety, edge cases, and store integration
log:
  - Successfully implemented getActiveChatMode function in the conversation
    store. The function derives chat mode from the selected conversation with
    proper null safety, reactive behavior, and performance optimization. Added
    comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios including edge cases,
    performance requirements, and type safety verification. All tests pass and
    quality checks are successful.

# Add getActiveChatMode Function to Conversation Store

## Context

Integrate chat mode functionality into the existing `useConversationStore` by adding a function that derives the active chat mode from the selected conversation. This function will serve as the foundation for all chat mode-related operations in the store.

## Detailed Requirements

### Implementation Details

Add `getActiveChatMode()` function to the conversation store that:

- Returns `'manual' | 'round-robin' | null` based on the active conversation
- Derives chat mode from selected conversation (no separate state storage)
- Handles null safety when no conversation is selected
- Provides reactive updates when conversation selection changes

### Technical Approach

```typescript
// Add to useConversationStore
getActiveChatMode: (): "manual" | "round-robin" | null => {
  const { activeConversationId, conversations } = get();
  if (!activeConversationId) return null;

  const conversation = conversations.find(
    (c) => c.id === activeConversationId,
  );
  return conversation?.chat_mode || null;
},
```

### Files to Modify

- `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/useConversationStore.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Function Implementation**: `getActiveChatMode()` function added to store with correct return type
- [ ] **State Derivation**: Chat mode always derived from conversation, never stored separately
- [ ] **Null Safety**: Returns null when no conversation is selected or conversation not found
- [ ] **Reactivity**: Function returns updated chat mode when conversation selection changes
- [ ] **Performance**: Function execution has negligible performance impact (<1ms)
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all scenarios including null cases
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Function properly typed with literal union return type

## Testing Requirements

Write unit tests covering:

- Returns correct chat mode for active conversation
- Returns null when no conversation is selected
- Returns null when conversation is not found in array
- Performance benchmark for typical conversation arrays
- Type safety verification

## Dependencies

- Requires F-database-schema-and-core-types completion (Conversation type includes chat_mode field)
- Must work with existing conversation loading and selection logic

## Out of Scope

- Do not implement chat mode setting functionality (separate task)
- Do not modify existing conversation loading logic
- Do not add UI components or user interaction
