# Enhance Agent Addition Integration

## Context

The `addAgent` method in `useConversationStore.ts` already has basic Round Robin integration, but needs enhancement to properly handle the first agent auto-enable behavior and ensure consistency with the feature specifications.

## Technical Approach

Review and enhance the existing `addAgent` method integration with chat mode handlers to ensure proper first agent auto-enabling and subsequent agent handling in Round Robin mode.

## Detailed Requirements

### First Agent Auto-Enable Enhancement

- Ensure first agent added to empty Round Robin conversation is automatically enabled
- Verify RoundRobinChatMode.handleAgentAdded returns correct intent for empty conversations
- Ensure proper integration with existing `processAgentIntent` method

### Subsequent Agent Behavior

- Verify subsequent agents are added in disabled state (preserving current enabled agent)
- Ensure no disruption to ongoing conversations when adding new agents
- Maintain single-enabled invariant during agent addition

### Integration Validation

- Verify existing chat mode handler integration in `addAgent` method
- Ensure error handling works properly during agent addition with mode rules
- Validate loading state management during agent addition

### Race Condition Protection

- Ensure agent addition with mode rules uses existing request token pattern
- Prevent concurrent additions from creating invalid states
- Safe handling of rapid agent additions

### Implementation Review

```typescript
// Existing addAgent implementation should handle:
addAgent: async (agent: CreateConversationAgentInput) => {
  // ... existing validation and creation logic

  try {
    const newAgent = await conversationService.addAgent(
      activeConversationId,
      agent,
      requestToken,
    );

    // Apply chat mode rules after successful addition
    const activeChatMode = get().getActiveChatMode();
    const chatModeHandler = createChatModeHandler(activeChatMode);
    const intent = chatModeHandler.handleAgentAdded(
      updatedAgents, // agents including the new one
      newAgent.id,
    );

    await get().processAgentIntent(intent);
    // ... success handling
  } catch (error) {
    // ... error handling
  }
};
```

### Error Handling Enhancement

- Ensure agent addition failures don't leave invalid mode states
- Proper rollback if mode rule application fails after agent creation
- Clear error messages for mode-related addition failures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] First agent added to empty Round Robin conversation is automatically enabled
- [ ] Subsequent agents are added in disabled state (current enabled preserved)
- [ ] Agent addition respects single-enabled invariant in Round Robin mode
- [ ] Manual mode behavior unchanged (no automatic enabling/disabling)
- [ ] Race condition protection works with agent addition
- [ ] Error handling prevents invalid states after failed additions
- [ ] Loading states properly managed during mode rule application
- [ ] Integration maintains existing request token pattern

## Files to Modify

- `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/useConversationStore.ts` - Review and enhance addAgent method

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for first agent addition to empty Round Robin conversation
- Unit tests for subsequent agent additions (preserve current enabled)
- Unit tests for Manual mode agent addition (no mode rules applied)
- Unit tests for error handling during agent addition with mode rules
- Unit tests for race condition scenarios with agent addition
- Integration tests for complete agent addition workflows

## Dependencies

- Requires existing `processAgentIntent` method
- Requires existing `getActiveChatMode` method
- Requires RoundRobinChatMode.handleAgentAdded implementation
- Requires existing request token race condition protection

## Out of Scope

- Batch agent addition functionality
- UI feedback specific to mode rule application
- Undo functionality for agent addition
