# Create Comprehensive End-to-End Tests

## Context

Round Robin behavior needs comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure all workflows function correctly from conversation creation through multi-agent rotation. This includes testing the complete user journey and integration between all components.

## Technical Approach

Create end-to-end test suites using existing testing patterns that cover complete Round Robin workflows, edge cases, and integration scenarios.

## Detailed Requirements

### Complete Workflow Testing

- Conversation creation with Round Robin mode
- First agent addition and auto-enable
- Multiple agent additions maintaining single-enabled invariant
- Agent response completion triggering automatic rotation
- Manual agent overrides in Round Robin mode
- Mode switching between Manual and Round Robin

### Multi-Agent Rotation Testing

- Sequential rotation through multiple agents (3-5 agents)
- Correct rotation order by display_order then added_at
- Wrap-around rotation from last agent to first
- Rotation timing and response event integration

### Edge Case Workflow Testing

- Single agent Round Robin conversations (no rotation flicker)
- Empty conversation agent list handling
- Agent removal during active rotation
- Mode switching with various agent configurations
- Invalid state recovery workflows

### Manual Override Integration Testing

- User disabling current enabled agent
- User enabling different agent (auto-disable current)
- Override behavior maintaining Round Robin invariants
- Subsequent automatic rotation after manual overrides

### Error Scenario Testing

- Service failures during rotation
- Network errors during mode switching
- Race conditions with rapid operations
- Recovery from invalid states
- Error handling without app crashes

### Implementation Approach

```typescript
// Example E2E test structure for Round Robin workflows
describe("Round Robin Complete Workflows", () => {
  describe("Conversation Creation and First Agent", () => {
    it("should auto-enable first agent in new Round Robin conversation", async () => {
      // Create conversation with round-robin mode
      // Add first agent
      // Verify agent is automatically enabled
      // Verify UI shows correct enabled state
    });
  });

  describe("Multi-Agent Rotation Workflow", () => {
    it("should rotate through multiple agents in correct order", async () => {
      // Create conversation with 3 agents in specific order
      // Trigger agent response completion events
      // Verify rotation follows display_order then added_at
      // Verify each agent gets enabled in sequence
      // Verify wrap-around from last to first agent
    });
  });

  describe("Manual Override Integration", () => {
    it("should handle manual overrides and continue rotation", async () => {
      // Set up Round Robin conversation with multiple agents
      // User manually switches to different agent
      // Trigger response completion
      // Verify automatic rotation continues from new agent
    });
  });
});
```

### Performance and Load Testing

- Large conversation rotation (20+ agents)
- Rapid rotation sequences (stress testing)
- Concurrent user operations
- Memory usage during extended rotation sessions

### Cross-Integration Testing

- Integration with existing conversation management
- Integration with agent response event system
- Integration with UI components (ChatModeSelector, AgentPill)
- Integration with service layer and database operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete Round Robin workflow tests from creation to rotation
- [ ] Multi-agent rotation tested with 3-5 agents in various orders
- [ ] Edge case workflows covered (single agent, empty, removal)
- [ ] Manual override workflows tested with automatic rotation continuation
- [ ] Error scenario recovery tested without app crashes
- [ ] Performance tests pass for large conversations (20+ agents)
- [ ] All tests use realistic data and timing scenarios
- [ ] Tests provide clear failure messages for debugging

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/__tests__/roundRobinWorkflows.test.ts` - Comprehensive workflow tests
- `apps/desktop/src/components/chat/__tests__/RoundRobinIntegration.test.tsx` - UI integration tests
- Existing test files - Add Round Robin scenarios to existing test suites

## Testing Requirements

- End-to-end workflow testing with realistic scenarios
- Integration testing across store, service, and UI layers
- Performance testing for large agent counts
- Error scenario testing with recovery validation
- Cross-browser compatibility testing (desktop app)
- Memory usage and cleanup testing

## Dependencies

- Requires all Round Robin implementation tasks to be complete
- Requires existing test utilities and patterns
- Requires mock agent and conversation factories
- Requires existing performance testing infrastructure

## Out of Scope

- UI automation testing (focus on logic and integration)
- Load testing with real network conditions
- Cross-platform mobile testing (desktop focus)
