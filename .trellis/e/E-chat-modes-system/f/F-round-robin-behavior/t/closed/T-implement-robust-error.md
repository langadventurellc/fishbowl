# Implement Robust Error Handling and Recovery

## Context

Round Robin mode operations (progression, mode switching, agent addition) need comprehensive error handling to ensure the application remains stable and users don't experience stuck states or crashes.

## Technical Approach

Enhance all Round Robin-related methods in `useConversationStore.ts` with robust error handling, recovery mechanisms, and proper logging for debugging and monitoring.

## Detailed Requirements

### Service Failure Handling

- Handle ConversationService failures gracefully with rollback
- Implement retry logic for transient network failures
- Clear error messages for permanent failures
- State restoration when service operations fail

### Race Condition Safety

- Enhance existing request token pattern for Round Robin operations
- Prevent concurrent Round Robin operations from corrupting state
- Safe handling when multiple users modify same conversation
- Queue management for rapid operation sequences

### Invalid State Detection and Recovery

- Detection of invalid Round Robin states (multiple agents enabled)
- Automatic recovery using `enforceRoundRobinInvariant`
- Logging of invalid state occurrences for debugging
- Prevention of cascading failures from invalid states

### Network Error Handling

- Offline behavior for Round Robin operations
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for network failures
- User feedback for network-related Round Robin failures
- Graceful degradation when service unavailable

### Implementation Details

```typescript
// Enhanced error handling pattern for Round Robin operations
const handleRoundRobinOperation = async (operation: () => Promise<void>) => {
  const maxRetries = 3;
  let attempts = 0;

  while (attempts < maxRetries) {
    try {
      await operation();
      return;
    } catch (error) {
      attempts++;

      if (isNetworkError(error) && attempts < maxRetries) {
        // Exponential backoff for network errors
        await new Promise((resolve) =>
          setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, attempts) * 1000),
        );
        continue;
      }

      // Log error for debugging
      console.error(
        `Round Robin operation failed after ${attempts} attempts:`,
        error,
      );

      // Attempt state recovery for invalid states
      if (isInvalidStateError(error)) {
        try {
          await get().enforceRoundRobinInvariant();
          console.log("Successfully recovered from invalid Round Robin state");
        } catch (recoveryError) {
          console.error("Failed to recover from invalid state:", recoveryError);
        }
      }

      throw error;
    }
  }
};
```

### Error Classification

- Network errors (retry with backoff)
- Service errors (no retry, user notification)
- Invalid state errors (attempt recovery)
- Race condition errors (token-based prevention)

### Recovery Strategies

- Automatic invariant enforcement for invalid states
- State refresh from service for corruption detection
- User notification for unrecoverable errors
- Graceful fallback to Manual mode in extreme cases

### Logging Enhancement

- Structured logging for Round Robin operations
- Error categorization for monitoring
- Performance metrics for operation timing
- Debug information for troubleshooting

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Service failures handled gracefully with proper rollback
- [ ] Network errors retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- [ ] Invalid states automatically trigger recovery attempts
- [ ] Race conditions prevented using existing request token pattern
- [ ] All errors logged with appropriate detail level
- [ ] Users receive clear error messages for actionable failures
- [ ] Application never crashes from Round Robin operation errors
- [ ] State corruption automatically detected and repaired

## Files to Modify

- `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/useConversationStore.ts` - Enhance error handling across all Round Robin methods

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for service failure scenarios with rollback
- Unit tests for network error retry logic
- Unit tests for invalid state detection and recovery
- Unit tests for race condition prevention
- Unit tests for error logging and classification
- Integration tests for complete error handling workflows
- Performance tests for error handling overhead

## Dependencies

- Requires existing `enforceRoundRobinInvariant` method
- Requires existing request token race condition protection
- Requires error classification utilities (may need creation)
- Requires existing ConversationService error patterns

## Out of Scope

- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems
- User-configurable error handling preferences
- Automatic error reporting to external services
