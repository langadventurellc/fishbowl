# Dynamic Personality Slider Component

## Overview

Create a reusable, controlled PersonalitySlider component that implements discrete value behavior, visual tick marks, dynamic metadata display, and comprehensive accessibility features for the personality configuration system. Keep it platform-agnostic and free of any IO/IPC; metadata is provided by the parent.

## Purpose

This feature provides the core UI component that replaces continuous sliders with discrete sliders, displaying contextual personality descriptions and providing superior accessibility support.

## Key Components to Implement

### PersonalitySlider Component

- Controlled component with discrete value behavior (`step=20`, `min=0`, `max=100`)
- Visual tick marks at each discrete position (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
- Displays current value's short description (provided via prop or resolver from parent)
- Full accessibility support with proper ARIA attributes and live announcements (debounced)
- No IO/IPC or JSON loading inside the component

### Visual Design Elements

- Discrete tick marks positioned at valid values
- Clear visual indication of current value position
- Responsive layout that works across different screen sizes
- Consistent styling with existing design system

### Accessibility Features

- Screen reader support with descriptive `aria-valuetext`
- Keyboard navigation moving by discrete steps (Arrow keys)
- Home/End jump to min/max values
- Live description updates announced to screen readers (polite; debounced)
- Proper focus management and visual focus indicators

### Metadata Integration

- Display trait's short description based on current value
- Dynamic updates when slider value changes
- Parent provides short description (string) or a typed resolver callback; component performs no IO
- Fallback handling when descriptions are unavailable

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Core Slider Functionality

- [ ] Slider accepts only discrete values: 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100
- [ ] `step=20`, `min=0`, `max=100` configuration enforces discrete behavior
- [ ] Dragging snaps to nearest discrete value when past halfway point
- [ ] Click-to-position jumps to nearest discrete value
- [ ] Value changes trigger immediate callback with discrete value

### Keyboard Navigation

- [ ] Arrow keys move by 20-point increments between discrete values
- [ ] Home key jumps to minimum value (0)
- [ ] End key jumps to maximum value (100)
- [ ] Tab navigation follows logical focus order

### Visual Tick Marks

- [ ] Visible tick marks displayed at positions 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100
- [ ] Active/current value tick mark visually highlighted
- [ ] Tick marks aligned properly with slider track
- [ ] Responsive design maintains alignment across screen sizes
- [ ] Tick marks use consistent styling with design system

### Dynamic Description Display

- [ ] Current value's short description displayed below slider
- [ ] Description updates immediately when value changes (< 100ms)
- [ ] Fallback to generic text when specific description unavailable
- [ ] Description text truncates gracefully on smaller screens
- [ ] Proper spacing and typography for description text

### Accessibility Implementation

- [ ] `aria-valuetext` reflects current short description text
- [ ] `aria-labelledby`/`aria-label` provide descriptive labeling
- [ ] `aria-describedby` points to the visible short description element
- [ ] `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, `aria-valuenow` properly set
- [ ] Live region politely announces description changes (debounced)
- [ ] Focus indicators clearly visible for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards for all visual elements

### Component Interface

- [ ] Props interface supports trait id, label, current value, change handler
- [ ] Accepts either `shortText` (string) or `getShort?: (traitId: string, value: DiscreteValue) => string | undefined`
- [ ] Optional props for disabled state and custom styling
- [ ] TypeScript props with proper discrete value typing
- [ ] Consistent prop naming with existing slider components
- [ ] Default props for common use cases

### Integration with Metadata Service

- [ ] Component does not perform IO/IPC; parent provides `shortText` or `getShort`
- [ ] If `getShort` provided, it must be synchronous and pure (no async/IO)
- [ ] Fallback gracefully when description unavailable

### Responsive Design

None - desktop only application.

## Implementation Guidance

### Technical Approach

- Build on existing design system Slider (Radix-based) with `step=20`
- Use Tailwind (consistent with codebase) for visuals; avoid CSS modules unless necessary
- Position tick marks via relative container with absolutely positioned ticks or linear-gradient background
- Debounce screen reader announcements only (no debouncing of onChange)
- Leverage React.memo/useCallback to reduce re-renders

### Component Structure

```typescript
import { DiscreteValue } from "@fishbowl-ai/shared/utils/discreteValues";

interface PersonalitySliderProps {
  traitId: string;
  label: string;
  value: DiscreteValue;
  onChange: (value: DiscreteValue) => void;
  shortText?: string;
  getShort?: (traitId: string, value: DiscreteValue) => string | undefined;
  disabled?: boolean;
  className?: string;
}
```

### File Structure

```
apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/
├── PersonalitySlider.tsx
├── __tests__/
│   └── PersonalitySlider.test.tsx
└── index.ts (updated exports)
```

### Dependencies

- Requires discrete value system feature for value logic
- Uses existing Radix-based Slider from the design system
- Parent integrates with metadata loader for descriptions
- Tailwind for styling and tick marks

## Testing Requirements

### Component Tests

- Render with various discrete values and verify display
- Test keyboard navigation through all discrete values
- Verify onChange callback receives correct discrete values
- Test disabled state behavior and visual indication

### Accessibility Tests

- Screen reader announcements for value changes
- ARIA attributes correctly set for all states
- Keyboard navigation follows expected patterns
- Focus management during interaction

### Visual Tests

- Tick mark positioning at correct discrete values
- Description display and updates
- Responsive behavior across screen sizes
- Design system consistency

### Integration Tests

- Integration with personality metadata loader
- Error handling when descriptions unavailable
- Performance with rapid value changes

## Performance Requirements

- [ ] Slider interactions respond within 50ms
- [ ] Description updates complete within 100ms
- [ ] Component re-renders minimized during rapid interactions
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended use

## Accessibility Standards

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility tested with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- Keyboard-only navigation fully functional
- High contrast mode compatibility

## Security Considerations

- Input validation ensures only discrete values accepted
- XSS prevention in dynamic description display
- Safe handling of metadata from external JSON source

## Design System Integration

- Consistent with existing slider components in visual style
- Follows established patterns for form controls
- Maintains brand colors and typography standards
- Supports theme variations (light/dark modes)
