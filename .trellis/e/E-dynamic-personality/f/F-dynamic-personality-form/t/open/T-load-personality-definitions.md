Context

- Decision: Load personality definitions in the modal (renderer) using PersonalityDefinitionsClient.
- The behaviors component requires synchronous `getShort` and section definitions without performing IO.

Goal
Enhance `PersonalityFormModal` to load personality section definitions once on open, manage loading/error states, and pass the following to `PersonalityForm`: `dynamicSections`, `dynamicGetShort`, `defsLoading`, `defsError`.

Files

- apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/PersonalityFormModal.tsx (update)
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/personalityDefinitionsClient.ts (use, not modify)

Implementation requirements

- Instantiate or reuse a `PersonalityDefinitionsClient` in the modal.
- On modal open:
  - set local state: `defsLoading=true`, `defsError=false`;
  - call `client.getDefinitions()`; on success set `sections` from `definitions.sections`; on failure set `defsError=true`.
  - finally set `defsLoading=false`.
- Build a synchronous `dynamicGetShort` function backed by in-memory maps:
  - After loading definitions, compute `Map<string, Map<DiscreteValue, string | undefined>>` for short descriptions.
  - Provide `dynamicGetShort = (id, value) => maps.get(id)?.get(value)`.
- Pass the new props to `PersonalityForm`:
  - `dynamicSections={sections}`
  - `dynamicGetShort={dynamicGetShort}`
  - `defsLoading={defsLoading}`
  - `defsError={defsError}`
- Disable submit when `defsError` is true (PersonalityForm already enforces via props per previous task).
- Accessibility: Announce loading and error state changes to screen readers via existing `announceToScreenReader` utility if easily hooked; otherwise ensure visible text communicates state.

Testing

- Extend/adjust modal-level tests minimally (if present) or provide guidance for manual verification if modal unit tests are not established.
- Ensure that opening the modal triggers definitions load and that errors disable interactions (verified through the formâ€™s disabled Save and component state).

Acceptance criteria

- Modal loads definitions and passes dynamic props to PersonalityForm
- When loading, behaviors area is disabled and shows placeholder state; when error, behaviors area is disabled and Save is disabled
- No IO happens inside PersonalityForm or the dynamic component

Security considerations

- Handle and log errors without leaking stack traces to UI
- No direct DOM injection from loaded data

Out of scope

- Deleting legacy component files
- Cross-modal caching or global prefetching (can be a future enhancement)
