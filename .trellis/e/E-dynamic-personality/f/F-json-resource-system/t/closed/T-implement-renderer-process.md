log:
  - Implemented renderer process personality definitions proxy service with
    comprehensive caching, error handling, and convenience methods. Added IPC
    integration to preload script and ElectronAPI types. Service provides
    session-level memory caching, helper methods for trait value lookups, and
    integrates with existing renderer services pattern. All quality checks and
    tests pass.

# Implement renderer process personality definitions proxy

## Context

Create a thin proxy service in the renderer process that calls the main process IPC handler and caches the results in memory for the session. This provides a clean interface for UI components to access personality definitions.

## Implementation Requirements

### Proxy Service Implementation

- Create renderer service that wraps IPC calls to main process
- Implement session-level memory caching to avoid redundant IPC calls
- Provide methods to access personality definitions and lookup utilities (e.g., `getShort(traitId, value)`)
- Handle IPC errors gracefully and return structured errors to UI

### Caching Strategy

- Cache personality definitions in memory after first successful load
- Provide cache invalidation method for development/testing
- Avoid redundant IPC calls during the same renderer session
- Handle cache initialization and error states

### Service Integration

- Integrate with existing renderer services pattern
- Add to `RendererProcessServices` class
- Follow dependency injection pattern used by other renderer services
- Export service interface for use by UI components

### Files to Create/Modify

- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/personalityDefinitionsClient.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/RendererProcessServices.ts` - Add service integration
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/index.ts` - Export new service
- Unit tests for renderer proxy service

### Technical Approach

1. Create service class that wraps IPC calls using `window.electron.invoke()`
2. Implement memory caching with Map or similar structure
3. Provide helper methods for common lookup operations
4. Handle async operations with proper error propagation
5. Follow existing renderer service patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Renderer proxy fetches via IPC and caches in memory
- [ ] Session-level caching prevents redundant IPC calls
- [ ] Service integrates with existing RendererProcessServices pattern
- [ ] Helper methods provided for common personality definition lookups
- [ ] IPC errors handled gracefully with structured error responses
- [ ] Cache can be invalidated for testing/development scenarios
- [ ] Service follows existing dependency injection patterns

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- IPC communication and error handling
- Memory caching behavior and cache invalidation
- Service integration with RendererProcessServices
- Helper method functionality and edge cases
- Error state handling and recovery

## Security Considerations

- Validate IPC responses before caching
- Handle untrusted data safely in renderer process
- Ensure cache doesn't grow unbounded
- Sanitize errors before exposing to UI

## Dependencies

- Requires IPC handler implementation from T-create-ipc-handler-for
- Existing renderer services infrastructure
- IPC communication utilities

## Out of Scope

- UI component integration (future tasks)
- Form validation updates (future tasks)
- Dynamic personality form implementation (future tasks)
