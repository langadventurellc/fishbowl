# Dynamic Personality Configuration System

## Epic Overview

Transform the hardcoded personality configuration system into a flexible, data‑driven architecture that loads personality definitions from JSON resources and implements discrete value sliders for an intentional, simple user experience. Keep scope focused on desktop only and avoid over‑engineering.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture Issues

- **Hardcoded personality traits**: Big Five traits and behaviors are hardcoded in components
- **Continuous sliders**: All personality values allow any 0-100 value without discrete steps
- **Static definitions**: Trait descriptions and labels are embedded in component code
- **Schema mismatches**: Default personalities use different field names than form schema
- **Scattered configuration**: Personality definitions spread across multiple files
- **No metadata integration**: Rich personality descriptions in JSON not utilized

### Current Implementation

- `BigFiveSliders.tsx`: Hardcoded Big Five traits with static descriptions
- `BehaviorSlidersSection.tsx`: Hardcoded behavior sliders
- `PersonalityForm.tsx`: Hardcoded default values and form structure
- `personalitySchema.ts`: Schema allowing continuous 0-100 values
- `defaultPersonalities.json`: Uses outdated behavior field names
- `personality_definitions.json`: Rich metadata unused by application

## Epic Goals

### 1. Data‑Driven Configuration

Replace all hardcoded personality definitions with dynamic loading from JSON resource files, enabling easy modification of personality traits without code changes.

### 2. Discrete Value System

Transform continuous sliders (0–100) into discrete sliders supporting only values: 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 with intuitive snapping behavior.

### 3. Integrated Metadata Display

Display contextual personality descriptions from metadata files, showing users meaningful insights like "Prefers tradition, cautious with new ideas." for specific values.

### 4. Unified, Simple Architecture

Create a single, consistent personality definition system (desktop‑only) that eliminates schema mismatches while keeping validation and loading simple.

## Detailed Requirements

### JSON‑Driven Configuration

- **Dynamic sections**: Load personality sections (Big 5, Communication Style, etc.) from `personality_definitions.json`. Big Five is treated as a normal section.
- **Stable trait IDs**: Each trait defines a stable `id` and a human‑readable `label`. The JSON provides per‑value metadata keyed by discrete values.
- **Build inclusion**: Include `resources/personality_definitions.json` in Electron Builder `extraResources`.
- **Runtime copy**: On first run, copy the JSON from the app bundle into `app.getPath('userData')/personality_definitions.json` if missing. Subsequent runs read from `userData`.
- **Dev mode**: In development, load directly from the repo `resources/` path to simplify iteration.

### Discrete Slider Implementation

- **Valid values**: Only 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 allowed.
- **Step**: Use slider `step=20`, `min=0`, `max=100` so the handle only lands on valid values.
- **Snap behavior**: Past halfway snaps to the next value (naturally enforced by step).
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys move by 20 between discrete values.
- **Visual feedback**: Show discrete tick marks/markers at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100.
- **Accessibility text**: `aria-valuetext` uses the trait’s current value short description.

### Metadata Integration

- **Description display**: Show the "short" description from metadata for the current value beneath each slider.
- **Dynamic updates**: Description updates immediately when the slider value changes.
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support; `aria-valuetext` reflects the current short description.
- **Responsive layout**: Proper display across different screen sizes.

### Schema and Data Updates

- **Validation refinement**: Update Zod validation to accept only discrete values (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) using refinement.
- **Permissive keys**: Keep keys permissive (e.g., `record<string, number>`) so UI can be driven by JSON without regenerating schemas.
- **Default updates**: Convert default personality values to discrete values, rounding to nearest; when exactly halfway, round up to 60 to reflect “positively charged balanced.”
- **Field name alignment**: Align default personality keys with the new JSON trait `id`s.

### Build System Integration (Desktop only)

- **Extra resources**: Add `resources/personality_definitions.json` to `apps/desktop/package.json -> build.extraResources`.
- **First‑run copy**: At app startup, copy definitions into `userData` if missing; always read from `userData` in production.
- **Dev resolution**: In development, read from repo `resources/` directly.
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling with logs; avoid falling back to hardcoded traits to keep code simple.

## Technical Architecture

### JSON Shape (simplified)

```jsonc
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "big5",
      "name": "Big 5 Personality Traits",
      "description": "optional",
      "traits": [
        {
          "id": "openness",
          "label": "Openness",
          "values": {
            "0": { "short": "…", "prompt": "…" },
            "20": { "short": "…", "prompt": "…" },
            "40": { "short": "…", "prompt": "…" },
            "60": { "short": "…", "prompt": "…" },
            "80": { "short": "…", "prompt": "…" },
            "100": { "short": "…", "prompt": "…" },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

### Dynamic Component System

```typescript
interface PersonalityValueMeta {
  short: string;
  prompt: string;
}

interface PersonalityTraitDef {
  id: string; // stable key (e.g., "openness")
  label: string; // display label (e.g., "Openness")
  values: Record<"0" | "20" | "40" | "60" | "80" | "100", PersonalityValueMeta>;
}

interface PersonalitySectionDef {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  traits: PersonalityTraitDef[];
}

interface DynamicPersonalityFormProps {
  sections: PersonalitySectionDef[];
  values: Record<string, number>; // keyed by trait.id
  onChange: (traitId: string, value: number) => void;
}
```

### Discrete Value Logic

```typescript
export const DISCRETE_VALUES = [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100] as const;
export type DiscreteValue = (typeof DISCRETE_VALUES)[number];

export const snapToNearestDiscrete = (value: number): DiscreteValue => {
  // Round to nearest; if exactly halfway, round up (favor 60 over 40, etc.)
  const clamped = Math.min(100, Math.max(0, value));
  const idx = Math.round(clamped / 20); // .5 rounds up
  return DISCRETE_VALUES[idx] as DiscreteValue;
};
```

### Metadata Loader (minimal)

```typescript
export interface PersonalityDefinitions {
  sections: PersonalitySectionDef[];
}

export interface PersonalityMetadataLoader {
  load(): Promise<PersonalityDefinitions>; // cached in memory
  getShort(traitId: string, value: DiscreteValue): string | undefined;
  getSections(): PersonalitySectionDef[]; // after load()
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Data‑Driven Implementation

- [ ] JSON loading errors handled gracefully with logs
- [ ] Performance impact minimized for JSON loading

## User Stories

### As a personality creator

- I want to see meaningful descriptions of personality traits so I understand what each value represents
- I want discrete slider values so I can make intentional personality choices rather than arbitrary numbers
- I want consistent behavior across all personality traits so I don't encounter unexpected differences

### As an application maintainer

- I want personality configurations in JSON so I can modify traits without code changes
- I want a unified personality system without schema mismatches
- I want a simple, desktop‑focused architecture that I can extend later

### As an accessibility user

- I want screen reader support for personality descriptions so I understand trait meanings
- I want keyboard navigation between discrete values so I can configure personalities efficiently
- I want clear audio feedback when values change so I know the system responded

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Add `extraResources` for JSON; implement first‑run copy to `userData` and dev/runtime path resolution
- Minimal metadata loader (cache + short description lookup)
- Schema refinement for discrete values

### Phase 2: Core UI

- Dynamic personality form rendering from JSON
- Reusable discrete `PersonalitySlider` with ticks and `aria-valuetext`
- Replace legacy hardcoded Big Five and behavior sections

### Phase 3: Defaults Update

- Update default personalities to use new trait ids and discrete values
- Apply rounding (nearest; halfway rounds up to 60)

### Phase 4: Polish

- Accessibility verification, visual ticks, docs, and small UX improvements

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **JSON loading failures**: Implement robust logs and safe defaults for values; avoid reintroducing hardcoded trait lists
- **Performance impact**: Cache loaded definitions and validate loading times
- **Schema breaks**: Test schema refinements and defaults update
- **Build complexity**: Desktop‑only resource handling and path resolution

### User Experience Risks

- **Slider confusion**: Clear discrete ticks and consistent snapping
- **Description overflow**: Responsive design testing with long description text
- **Accessibility regression**: Screen reader and keyboard testing

## Success Metrics

### Functionality

- All personality sections load dynamically from JSON configuration
- All sliders use discrete values (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) exclusively
- All traits display contextual descriptions based on current values
- No hardcoded personality definitions remain in component code

### Performance

- JSON loading completes within 100ms on typical devices
- Slider interactions remain responsive (<50ms feedback)
- Description updates are immediate (<100ms)
- Application startup time increase <200ms

### User Experience

- User testing shows improved understanding of personality traits
- Accessibility testing confirms screen reader compatibility
- No regressions in existing personality configuration workflows
- Enhanced discoverability of personality customization options

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- Desktop build system configuration (Vite/Electron Builder)
- Existing form validation and state management systems
- UI component library (slider, form components)
- Screen reader and accessibility infrastructure

### External Dependencies

- JSON parsing and validation libraries (already available)
- File system access APIs for resource loading
- Electron app bundle resource access

### Critical Path

1. Build/runtime resource handling must complete before component development
2. Schema updates must complete before defaults update
3. Dynamic form system must complete before legacy component removal
4. Polish and a11y follow core functionality

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Discrete value snapping logic and edge cases
- JSON loading and parsing with malformed data
- Schema validation with discrete values
- Component rendering with dynamic sections

### Integration Testing
