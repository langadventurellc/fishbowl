# Remove Unused Dev Dependencies from Package.json Files

## Context

Knip analysis identified 8 unused dev dependencies that are not being used in development workflows and can be safely removed to clean up package.json files.

## Final Implementation Results

Successfully removed 7 of 8 unused dev dependencies. One dependency (`tailwindcss` from `packages/ui-theme/package.json`) was restored after discovering it's actually used in CSS files.

**Dependencies Removed:**

- `@electron/rebuild` from `apps/desktop/package.json:64:6` ✅
- `tailwindcss` from `apps/desktop/package.json:82:6` ✅
- `tw-animate-css` from `apps/desktop/package.json:84:6` ✅
- `@babel/core` from `apps/mobile/package.json:68:6` ✅
- `@react-native-community/cli` from `apps/mobile/package.json:70:6` ✅
- `babel-jest` from `apps/mobile/package.json:74:6` ✅
- `@testing-library/react` from `packages/shared/package.json:29:6` ✅
- `tailwindcss` from `packages/ui-theme/package.json:27:6` ❌ **Restored** (actually needed by CSS imports)

## Technical Approach

1. ✅ Edit each package.json file to remove the specified unused dev dependencies
2. ✅ Run `pnpm install` to update lockfiles
3. ❌ **Issue discovered**: `tailwindcss` removal broke build due to `@import "tailwindcss";` in `claymorphism-theme.css`
4. ✅ Restored `tailwindcss` to `packages/ui-theme/package.json` and re-ran `pnpm install`
5. ✅ Verify development workflows still function (lint, format, type-check, test)
6. ✅ Check that build processes remain unaffected

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ 7 of 8 unused dev dependencies removed from their respective package.json files
- ✅ 1 dependency correctly restored after discovering actual usage
- ✅ Development lockfiles updated correctly
- ✅ All development commands continue to work: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format`, `pnpm type-check`
- ✅ Build processes unaffected by dev dependency removal
- ✅ Testing workflows continue to function properly
- ✅ No warnings about missing dev dependencies during builds

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Verify removed dev dependencies aren't required for security scanning tools
- ✅ Ensure no development security tools are inadvertently removed

## Testing Requirements

- ✅ Run quality checks: `pnpm quality`
- ✅ Verify linting works: `pnpm lint`
- ✅ Confirm formatting works: `pnpm format`
- ✅ Test TypeScript compilation: `pnpm type-check`
- ✅ Run unit tests: `pnpm test`

## Dependencies

None - this task can be completed independently.

## Notes

The Knip analysis gave a false positive for `tailwindcss` in the `ui-theme` package. While it's not imported in TypeScript files, it's used via CSS `@import "tailwindcss";` and Tailwind directives like `@layer` and `@apply` in the theme files. This demonstrates the importance of verifying removal by running builds, not just trusting static analysis tools.
