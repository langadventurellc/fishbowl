log:
  - Fixed duplicate default exports in personality components by removing
    redundant default export statements. Both BehaviorSlidersSection and
    BigFiveSliders components already had named exports, so the default exports
    were unnecessary and causing build ambiguity. All imports were already using
    named exports, so no other code needed to be changed. All quality checks
    pass and knip no longer reports duplicate export issues.

# Fix Duplicate Default Exports in Personality Components

## Context

Knip analysis identified 2 components with duplicate default exports that can cause build issues and import ambiguity:

- `BehaviorSlidersSection` in `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/BehaviorSlidersSection.tsx`
- `BigFiveSliders` in `apps/desktop/src/components/settings/personalities/BigFiveSliders.tsx`

## Specific Implementation Requirements

1. Examine both component files to understand the duplicate export structure
2. Ensure each component has only one default export
3. If there are multiple exports, convert additional ones to named exports
4. Update any import statements that rely on the duplicate exports

## Technical Approach

1. Read the contents of both affected component files
2. Identify the cause of duplicate exports (likely multiple export default statements)
3. Refactor to use a single default export with additional named exports if needed
4. Search codebase for imports of these components to ensure compatibility
5. Update import statements as necessary

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

- Each component file has exactly one default export
- All named exports are properly declared if needed
- No build errors related to duplicate exports
- All existing imports continue to work correctly
- Components render and function as expected
- TypeScript compilation passes without export-related errors

## Security Considerations

- No security implications for this refactoring
- Maintain existing component functionality and props interfaces

## Testing Requirements

- Verify components still render correctly in the desktop app
- Run TypeScript compilation: `pnpm type-check`
- Run linting to catch any export issues: `pnpm lint`
- Test settings/personalities screens function correctly
- Include unit tests for the refactored components

## Dependencies

None - this task can be completed independently.
