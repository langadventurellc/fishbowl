parent: F-delete-conversation-agent
prerequisites:
  - T-add-ondelete-prop-to
affectedFiles:
  apps/desktop/src/components/chat/AgentPill.tsx: Added X button implementation
    with lucide-react X icon import, onDelete prop destructuring,
    handleDeleteClick function with event.stopPropagation(), and conditional X
    button render with proper hover states, accessibility attributes, and
    styling classes for smooth transitions
  apps/desktop/src/components/chat/__tests__/AgentPill.test.tsx:
    Created comprehensive unit test suite with 16 test cases covering component
    rendering, delete button functionality, event handling, accessibility, and
    visual states. Includes proper mocking of lucide-react and useChatStore,
    tests for hover behavior, event propagation prevention, and CSS class
    validation
log:
  - Successfully implemented X button and delete handling in AgentPill
    component. Added hover-triggered delete button positioned on the right side
    of pills that appears only when onDelete prop is provided. Implemented
    proper event handling with stopPropagation to prevent conflicts with
    existing toggle functionality. Created comprehensive unit tests covering all
    functionality including rendering states, event handling, accessibility, and
    visual styling. All quality checks pass including linting, formatting, type
    checking, and unit tests.

# Implement X Button and Delete Handling in AgentPill Component

## Context

This task adds the visual delete button (X) and click handling logic to the AgentPill component. The X button appears on hover and triggers the delete callback while preventing conflicts with the existing enable/disable toggle functionality.

**Feature Reference**: F-delete-conversation-agent
**Prerequisites**: T-add-ondelete-prop-to (requires onDelete prop in AgentPillProps interface)
**Related Files**: `apps/desktop/src/components/chat/AgentPill.tsx`

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Primary Objective

Add a delete button (X) to the right side of agent pills that appears on hover, handles click events correctly, and maintains separation from the existing toggle functionality.

### Technical Approach

1. **UI Implementation**:
   - Add X button positioned on the right side of the pill (~16px from edge)
   - Show X button only when `onDelete` prop is provided and user hovers over pill
   - Use smooth transition (150ms) for X button appearance
   - Ensure click target is minimum 24x24px for accessibility

2. **Click Event Handling**:
   - Use `event.stopPropagation()` on X button to prevent toggle behavior
   - Maintain existing click behavior for main pill area (left ~80%)
   - Call `onDelete(conversationAgentId)` when X button is clicked
   - Ensure proper event handling for keyboard navigation

3. **Visual States**:
   - X button has hover state with increased opacity
   - Maintain all existing pill states (enabled, disabled, thinking, error, etc.)
   - X button styling should integrate with pill theme
   - Responsive design across different pill sizes

### Detailed Acceptance Criteria

**Visual Requirements**:

- ✅ X button appears only when `onDelete` prop is provided
- ✅ X button shows only on hover over the entire pill
- ✅ X button positioned 16px from right edge of pill
- ✅ X button size is 16x16px icon with 24x24px click target minimum
- ✅ Smooth transition (150ms) when X button appears/disappears
- ✅ X button has hover state with slightly increased opacity

**Interaction Requirements**:

- ✅ Clicking X button calls `onDelete(conversationAgentId)` if provided
- ✅ Clicking X button prevents enable/disable toggle (`event.stopPropagation()`)
- ✅ Clicking main pill area (left ~80%) still triggers toggle behavior
- ✅ Keyboard navigation works correctly with X button
- ✅ Touch devices handle X button interaction appropriately

**State Management**:

- ✅ X button respects all existing pill states (enabled, disabled, thinking, error)
- ✅ X button maintains consistent appearance across different agent colors
- ✅ X button integrates properly with existing accessibility features
- ✅ Component maintains backward compatibility when onDelete prop not provided

**Testing Requirements**:

- ✅ Unit test for X button rendering when onDelete prop provided
- ✅ Unit test for X button not rendering when onDelete prop absent
- ✅ Unit test for click event handling (X button vs main pill area)
- ✅ Unit test for hover behavior and transitions
- ✅ Unit test for keyboard navigation with X button
- ✅ Unit test for event.stopPropagation() preventing toggle

### Implementation Notes

**Styling Approach**:

- Use existing Tailwind classes and design system
- Ensure X button color contrasts well with pill background colors
- Consider using lucide-react X icon for consistency
- Maintain responsive design principles

**Event Handling Pattern**:

```typescript
const handleDeleteClick = (event: React.MouseEvent) => {
  event.stopPropagation(); // Prevent toggle behavior
  if (onDelete && conversationAgentId) {
    onDelete(conversationAgentId);
  }
};

const handleMainPillClick = () => {
  // Existing toggle logic remains unchanged
  if (onToggleEnabled && conversationAgentId) {
    onToggleEnabled(conversationAgentId);
  } else if (onClick) {
    onClick(agent.name);
  }
};
```

**Hover State Management**:

- Use CSS hover pseudo-class or React hover state
- Ensure X button appears on hover over entire pill, not just X area
- Handle touch devices appropriately (show X button when needed)

### Example Implementation Structure

```typescript
export function AgentPill({
  agent,
  onClick,
  onToggleEnabled,
  onDelete,
  conversationAgentId,
  showStatus = false,
  className,
}: AgentPillProps) {
  // ... existing logic

  const handleDeleteClick = (event: React.MouseEvent) => {
    event.stopPropagation();
    if (onDelete && conversationAgentId) {
      onDelete(conversationAgentId);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div
      // ... existing props
      className={cn(
        // ... existing classes
        "group", // Add group for hover effects
        className,
      )}
    >
      {/* Existing pill content */}
      <span>
        {agent.name} | {agent.role}
      </span>

      {/* Existing status indicators */}
      {/* ... status indicator logic */}

      {/* New X button - only when onDelete provided */}
      {onDelete && (
        <button
          onClick={handleDeleteClick}
          className="ml-2 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-150
                     hover:opacity-80 w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center
                     rounded-full hover:bg-black/10"
          aria-label={`Delete ${agent.name} from conversation`}
        >
          <X size={16} className="text-current" />
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Component should validate conversationAgentId before calling onDelete
- **Event Handling**: Proper event handling prevents unintended actions
- **Accessibility**: Ensure screen readers can identify delete functionality
- **User Intent**: Clear visual indication of destructive action

### Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: T-add-ondelete-prop-to (AgentPillProps interface with onDelete prop)
- **Depends on**: Existing AgentPill component structure, lucide-react icons, Tailwind CSS

### Out of Scope

- **Confirmation Dialog**: Will be handled by parent component integration task
- **Backend Integration**: Deletion logic will be handled by container components
- **Store Integration**: Will be handled by store integration tasks
- **End-to-end Testing**: Focus on component-level unit tests

## Success Metrics

- ✅ X button appears on hover when onDelete prop provided
- ✅ Click area separation works correctly (X button vs main pill)
- ✅ Visual transitions are smooth and responsive
- ✅ Component maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Unit tests provide comprehensive coverage of new functionality
