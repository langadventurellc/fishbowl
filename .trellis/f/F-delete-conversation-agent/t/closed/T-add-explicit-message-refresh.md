affectedFiles:
  packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/useConversationStore.ts:
    Added explicit message refresh after successful agent deletion using
    refreshActiveConversation() with race condition protection, conversation ID
    validation, and graceful error handling that logs failures without affecting
    main operation
  packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/__tests__/removeAgent.test.ts:
    Created comprehensive unit test suite with 15 test cases covering successful
    refresh scenarios, error handling, round-robin integration, edge cases, and
    race condition protection for the message refresh functionality
log:
  - Successfully implemented explicit message refresh functionality after agent
    deletion in useConversationStore. Added comprehensive error handling, race
    condition protection, and extensive unit test coverage. The implementation
    ensures the UI immediately reflects that deleted agent messages have been
    removed from the database while maintaining backward compatibility and
    robust error handling.

# Add Explicit Message Refresh After Agent Deletion in useConversationStore

## Context

This task ensures that the message list is properly refreshed after an agent is deleted, so that messages from the deleted agent are immediately removed from the UI. This addresses the requirement that both agent pills and agent messages disappear from the UI after deletion.

**Feature Reference**: F-delete-conversation-agent
**Prerequisites**: T-update-ipc-handler-for (requires backend delete functionality to be working)
**Related Files**: `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/useConversationStore.ts`

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Primary Objective

Modify the existing `removeAgent` method in useConversationStore to explicitly refresh messages after successful agent deletion, ensuring the UI immediately reflects that the agent's messages have been deleted from the database.

### Current Implementation Analysis

The current `removeAgent` method in useConversationStore likely only updates the agent list after deletion. We need to also refresh the message list to reflect that messages associated with the deleted agent have been removed.

### Technical Approach

1. **Enhanced removeAgent Method**:
   - Keep existing agent removal logic
   - Add explicit call to refresh messages after successful agent deletion
   - Use existing `refreshActiveConversation()` or `loadMessages()` method
   - Maintain existing error handling patterns

2. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Call message refresh after successful agent removal
   - Ensure refresh happens only on success, not on error
   - Maintain existing loading states and error handling
   - Use race condition protection with request tokens

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If message refresh fails after successful agent deletion, log error but don't fail the operation
   - Agent removal was successful, message refresh is supplementary
   - Show partial success state if needed

### Detailed Acceptance Criteria

**Message Refresh Requirements**:

- ✅ Messages are refreshed automatically after successful agent deletion
- ✅ Message refresh happens only after successful agent removal, not on error
- ✅ Uses existing message refresh mechanisms (refreshActiveConversation or loadMessages)
- ✅ Maintains race condition protection with request tokens
- ✅ Handles message refresh errors gracefully without affecting agent deletion success

**Integration Requirements**:

- ✅ Maintains existing removeAgent method signature and behavior
- ✅ Preserves all existing error handling for agent removal
- ✅ Maintains existing loading state management
- ✅ Uses established patterns for message refresh
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing callers

**State Management Requirements**:

- ✅ Updates both agent list and message list consistently
- ✅ Maintains existing race condition protection
- ✅ Preserves existing loading and error states
- ✅ Uses existing request token mechanism for consistency

**Testing Requirements**:

- ✅ Unit test for successful agent removal with message refresh
- ✅ Unit test for agent removal success with message refresh failure
- ✅ Unit test for agent removal failure (no message refresh attempted)
- ✅ Unit test for race condition handling with request tokens
- ✅ Unit test for loading state management during both operations

### Implementation Notes

**Message Refresh Strategy**:

- Use `refreshActiveConversation()` to refresh both agents and messages atomically
- This is more reliable than separate agent and message refresh calls
- Maintains consistency with existing refresh patterns in the store

**Error Handling Strategy**:

- Agent deletion success is primary - message refresh is supplementary
- Log message refresh errors but don't change agent deletion success status
- Consider partial success messaging if message refresh fails

**Example Implementation Structure**:

```typescript
removeAgent: async (conversationId: string, agentId: string) => {
  // ... existing implementation logic for agent removal

  try {
    // Existing agent removal logic
    await conversationService.removeAgent(conversationId, agentId);

    // Update agent list (existing logic)
    set((state) => ({
      ...state,
      activeConversationAgents: state.activeConversationAgents.filter(
        (agent) => agent.agent_id !== agentId,
      ),
      loading: { ...state.loading, agents: false },
    }));

    // NEW: Explicitly refresh messages to reflect deleted agent messages
    try {
      // Refresh entire conversation to ensure message list reflects deletion
      await get().refreshActiveConversation();
    } catch (messageRefreshError) {
      // Log error but don't fail the operation - agent deletion was successful
      logger.error("Failed to refresh messages after agent deletion",
        messageRefreshError instanceof Error ? messageRefreshError : undefined,
        { conversationId, agentId }
      );
      // Consider updating error state to indicate partial success
    }

    // ... existing round robin and other logic
  } catch (error) {
    // ... existing error handling
  }
},
```

**Alternative Approach (if refreshActiveConversation is too heavy)**:

```typescript
// Alternative: Direct message refresh only
await get().loadMessages(conversationId);
```

### Race Condition Considerations

- Ensure message refresh uses the same race condition protection as agent removal
- Verify the current request token is still active before performing message refresh
- Handle case where conversation selection changes during deletion process

### File Location

- `packages/ui-shared/src/stores/conversation/useConversationStore.ts`
- Specifically modify the existing `removeAgent` method

### Performance Considerations

- `refreshActiveConversation()` reloads both agents and messages - acceptable for deletion flow
- Alternative is direct `loadMessages()` call if performance is a concern
- Consider user feedback that deletion was successful even if message refresh is slower

### Security Considerations

- **Data Consistency**: Ensure UI accurately reflects database state after deletion
- **Race Conditions**: Use existing request token mechanism to prevent stale updates
- **Error Transparency**: Log detailed errors for debugging but show user-friendly messages

### Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: T-update-ipc-handler-for (backend delete functionality working)
- **Depends on**:
  - Existing useConversationStore infrastructure
  - refreshActiveConversation() or loadMessages() methods
  - Existing logging infrastructure

### Out of Scope

- **New Message Refresh Methods**: Use existing refresh mechanisms
- **Store Architecture Changes**: Minimal changes to existing removeAgent method
- **UI Component Changes**: UI integration handled by other tasks
- **Performance Optimization**: Focus on correctness, not performance optimization

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Agent messages disappear from UI immediately after agent deletion
- ✅ Both agent list and message list reflect deletion consistently
- ✅ Message refresh errors don't prevent successful agent deletion
- ✅ Race condition protection prevents stale updates
- ✅ Maintains existing removeAgent method behavior and performance
