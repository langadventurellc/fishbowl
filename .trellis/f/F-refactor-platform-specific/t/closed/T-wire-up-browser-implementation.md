affectedFiles:
  apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/RendererProcessServices.ts:
    Created service container class that initializes browser implementations and
    creates configured logger with dependency injection
  apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/index.ts: Added barrel export for RendererProcessServices
  apps/desktop/src/contexts/ServicesProvider.tsx: Created React context provider
    component for sharing services throughout renderer process
  apps/desktop/src/contexts/ServicesContext.tsx: Created React context for accessing renderer process services
  apps/desktop/src/contexts/useServices.tsx: Created React hook for consuming
    services from context with proper error handling
  apps/desktop/src/contexts/index.ts: Added exports for new service-related context components
  apps/desktop/src/main.tsx: Updated renderer initialization to create service
    container and wrap App with ServicesProvider
  apps/desktop/src/App.tsx:
    Updated to use configured logger from services context
    instead of creating its own logger
  apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/__tests__/RendererProcessServices.test.ts:
    Added comprehensive unit tests covering service initialization, browser
    implementations, logger configuration, and fallback behavior
  apps/desktop/src/App.test.tsx: Fixed failing tests by adding mock for
    useServices hook to provide necessary test context
log:
  - Successfully implemented browser implementations wiring in renderer process.
    Created RendererProcessServices container class that initializes
    BrowserCryptoUtils and BrowserDeviceInfo implementations and injects them
    into a configured logger. Integrated service container into renderer
    initialization via React context (ServicesProvider) and updated App.tsx to
    use the configured services. Fixed failing App tests by adding proper mocks
    for the new useServices hook. All quality checks pass and comprehensive unit
    tests verify correct service wiring and fallback behavior.

# Wire Up Browser Implementations in Renderer Process

## Context

Configure the Electron renderer process to create and inject browser/Web API implementations into shared services at startup. This mirrors the main process pattern but uses browser-compatible implementations.

**Target Files:**

- Renderer process startup/initialization code
- Service factory/container setup for renderer
- Export configured services for use throughout renderer process

## Implementation Requirements

### Create Renderer Service Container:

```typescript
// apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/ServiceContainer.ts
export class RendererProcessServices {
  readonly cryptoUtils: BrowserCryptoUtils;
  readonly deviceInfo: BrowserDeviceInfo;
  readonly logger: StructuredLogger;
  // Note: FileSystemBridge not needed in renderer

  constructor() {
    // Initialize browser implementations
    // Wire up services
  }
}
```

### Configure Services at Startup:

1. Create browser implementations (`BrowserCryptoUtils`, `BrowserDeviceInfo`)
2. Inject into shared services (`StructuredLogger`)
3. Handle services not needed in renderer (FileStorageService)
4. Export configured services for renderer process use
5. Set up in renderer process initialization

### Update Renderer Process Code:

- Find existing service initialization in renderer
- Replace with new dependency injection pattern
- Ensure renderer code uses configured services
- Remove any direct imports of shared platform-specific code

## Technical Approach

1. Create service container class for renderer process
2. Initialize browser implementations in container constructor
3. Wire implementations into applicable shared services
4. Update renderer process startup to use container
5. Export services from container for renderer consumption
6. Update existing renderer code to use injected services
7. Write unit tests for service wiring

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Service container created for renderer process
- [ ] Browser implementations properly initialized
- [ ] Shared services receive browser implementations via constructor
- [ ] Renderer process startup configures services correctly
- [ ] All renderer process code uses configured services
- [ ] No direct imports of platform-specific shared code
- [ ] Unit tests verify correct wiring
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds

## Dependencies

- Requires shared services to be updated for injection
- Requires browser implementations to be created

## Security Considerations

- Ensure service container is singleton in renderer process
- Validate browser APIs are available before initialization
- Handle graceful fallbacks for missing Web APIs

## Testing Requirements

- Unit test renderer service container initialization
- Test that correct browser implementations are injected
- Test renderer process can use all needed services
- Verify no shared platform-specific imports remain
- Test fallback behavior for missing browser APIs
