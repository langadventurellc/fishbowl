# Verify Build Passes After Platform Refactoring

## Context

Comprehensive verification that the platform-specific code refactoring is successful by ensuring all packages build correctly and the desktop application functions without platform-related errors.

**Critical Success Criteria:** The build must pass without any platform-specific import errors or runtime failures.

## Implementation Requirements

### Build Verification Steps:

1. **Shared Package Build**:
   - `pnpm build:libs` - Rebuild shared packages
   - Verify no platform-specific dependencies
   - Confirm TypeScript compilation succeeds

2. **Desktop Application Build**:
   - `pnpm build:desktop` - Full desktop build
   - Verify main process builds with Node implementations
   - Verify renderer process builds with browser implementations
   - No import resolution errors

3. **Type Checking**:
   - `pnpm type-check` - Comprehensive type checking
   - Verify all interfaces are properly implemented
   - Confirm dependency injection types are correct

4. **Quality Checks**:
   - `pnpm quality` - Linting, formatting, type checks
   - Fix any issues introduced during refactoring
   - Ensure code quality standards maintained

## Technical Verification

### Import Resolution Testing:

- Main process can import Node implementations
- Renderer process can import browser implementations
- Shared package has no platform-specific imports
- No circular dependencies created

### Runtime Verification:

- Desktop app starts without errors
- Main process services function correctly
- Renderer process services function correctly
- No platform-specific runtime errors in logs

### Functionality Testing:

- File operations work in main process
- Crypto utilities work in both processes
- Device info collection works in both processes
- Logging system functions correctly

## Technical Approach

1. Run shared package builds first (`pnpm build:libs`)
2. Run desktop application build (`pnpm build:desktop`)
3. Run comprehensive type checking (`pnpm type-check`)
4. Run quality checks (`pnpm quality`)
5. Start desktop application and verify no errors
6. Test basic functionality in both main and renderer processes
7. Check logs for any platform-related warnings or errors

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Shared package builds successfully (`pnpm build:libs`)
- [ ] Desktop application builds successfully (`pnpm build:desktop`)
- [ ] All type checking passes (`pnpm type-check`)
- [ ] Quality checks pass (`pnpm quality`)
- [ ] Desktop application starts without errors
- [ ] Main process uses Node implementations correctly
- [ ] Renderer process uses browser implementations correctly
- [ ] No platform-specific import errors
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] No runtime errors related to platform code

## Dependencies

- Requires all previous refactoring tasks to be completed

## Rollback Plan

If build fails:

- Identify specific failure points
- Check import paths and dependency injection
- Verify interface implementations
- Ensure all moved files are properly exported

## Success Metrics

- Build time remains reasonable
- No new TypeScript errors
- Application startup time unchanged
- All platform-specific functionality works as before
