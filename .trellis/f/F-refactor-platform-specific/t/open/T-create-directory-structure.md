# Create Directory Structure for Platform-Specific Implementations

## Context

Set up the foundational directory structure in the desktop app to house Node.js (main process) and browser (renderer process) implementations that will be moved from the shared package.

## Implementation Requirements

Create the following directory structure in the desktop app:

### Main Process Directories:

- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/` - For Node.js service implementations (FileSystemBridge)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/utils/` - For Node.js utility functions (crypto, device info)

### Renderer Process Directories:

- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/utils/` - For browser/Web API implementations (crypto, device info)

## Technical Approach

1. Create directories using the file system
2. Add `index.ts` barrel files for clean exports:
   - `apps/desktop/src/main/services/index.ts`
   - `apps/desktop/src/main/utils/index.ts`
   - `apps/desktop/src/renderer/utils/index.ts`
3. Ensure directories are included in TypeScript compilation paths

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All required directories exist with proper structure
- [ ] Barrel files (`index.ts`) created for organized exports
- [ ] TypeScript can resolve imports from new directories
- [ ] Desktop app build configuration recognizes new directories
- [ ] No build errors after directory creation

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundational setup task

## Testing Requirements

- Verify directories are created correctly
- Verify TypeScript compilation includes new paths
- Basic import test to ensure module resolution works
