# Task: Implement Happy Path Conversation Agent Creation Tests

## Context

Create the main end-to-end test file that covers the complete happy path workflow for conversation agent creation. This test verifies the core functionality from LLM setup through successful agent addition to conversations.

## Reference Patterns

- Test structure from `conversation/new-conversation-button.spec.ts`
- Agent testing patterns from `settings/agents/agent-creation.spec.ts`
- Create conversation test helpers `tests/desktop/helpers/conversations/createConversation.ts`
- Database verification from conversation tests
- Test organization from existing feature test suites

## Key UI Components to Interact With

When developing this task, you should examine these UI components to understand exactly how they work instead of making assumptions:

### Primary Workflow Components

- **NewConversationButton** (`apps/desktop/src/components/conversations/NewConversationButton.tsx`)
  - Button to create new conversations
- **AgentLabelsContainerDisplay** (`apps/desktop/src/components/layout/AgentLabelsContainerDisplay.tsx`)
  - Contains Add Agent button and displays agent pills
- **AddAgentToConversationModal** (`apps/desktop/src/components/modals/AddAgentToConversationModal.tsx`)
  - Modal for selecting and adding agents to conversations
- **AgentPill** (`apps/desktop/src/components/chat/AgentPill.tsx`)
  - Individual agent display components

### Settings Components (for setup)

- **LlmSetupSection** (`apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/LlmSetupSection.tsx`)
  - LLM provider configuration section
- **LlmConfigModal** (`apps/desktop/src/components/settings/llm-setup/LlmConfigModal.tsx`)
  - Modal for configuring LLM providers
- **AgentsSection** (`apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/AgentsSection.tsx`)
  - Agent management section in settings
- **AgentFormModal** (`apps/desktop/src/components/settings/agents/AgentFormModal.tsx`)
  - Modal for creating/editing agents

### UI Components

- **Dialog** (`apps/desktop/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`)
  - Base dialog component used by modals
- **Select** (`apps/desktop/src/components/ui/select.tsx`)
  - Dropdown components for selections
- **Button** (`apps/desktop/src/components/ui/button.tsx`)
  - Button components throughout the interface

## Test Coverage Requirements

This test file implements **Acceptance Criteria AC1** from the feature specification:

### AC1: Complete Happy Path Workflow

**Given** the application is launched with clean state  
**When** user completes the full conversation agent setup workflow:

1. Configure LLM provider in settings
2. Create agent in settings
3. Exit settings and create new conversation
4. Click Add Agent button in AgentLabelsContainerDisplay
5. Select agent in AddAgentToConversationModal
6. Confirm agent addition

**Then:**

- Agent appears in conversation's agent labels display
- Database contains conversation_agents record with correct relationship
- Agent can be successfully added to conversation
- UI reflects the agent association immediately

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create Main Test File

**File Path**: `tests/desktop/features/conversation-agents/conversation-agent-creation.spec.ts`

### 2. Test Structure

```typescript
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";
import {
  // Setup helpers
  setupConversationAgentTestSuite,
  setupConversationAgentTest,

  // UI helpers
  clickAddAgentButton,
  waitForAddAgentModal,
  selectAgentInModal,
  verifyAgentPillExists,
  waitForAgentInConversationDisplay,

  // Database helpers
  queryConversationAgents,
  waitForConversationAgentInDb,
} from "../../../helpers";

test.describe("Feature: Conversation Agent Creation - Happy Path", () => {
  const testSuite = setupConversationAgentTestSuite();

  // Test scenarios to implement
});
```

### 3. Test Scenarios to Implement

#### Scenario 1: Basic Agent Addition to Conversation

- **Setup**: Complete conversation agent test setup (LLM + Agent + Conversation)
- **Action**: Add agent to conversation via UI
- **Verification**:
  - Agent pill appears in UI
  - Database contains conversation_agents record
  - Record has correct conversation_id and agent_id relationship

#### Scenario 2: Agent Addition UI Feedback

- **Setup**: Complete conversation agent test setup
- **Action**: Add agent and monitor UI state changes
- **Verification**:
  - Add Agent button changes state during operation
  - Modal shows loading states appropriately
  - Success feedback displays correctly
  - Agent immediately visible after addition

#### Scenario 3: Database Record Verification

- **Setup**: Complete conversation agent test setup
- **Action**: Add agent to conversation
- **Verification**:
  - Database record created with correct structure
  - Foreign key relationships maintained
  - Timestamps populated correctly
  - unique constraint respected (conversation_id, agent_id)

#### Scenario 4: End-to-End Workflow Integration

- **Setup**: Start with completely clean application state
- **Action**: Complete full workflow from LLM setup to agent addition
- **Verification**:
  - All prerequisite steps complete successfully
  - Agent addition works after full setup
  - No integration issues between setup steps
  - Complete workflow is reliable and repeatable

### 4. Test Implementation Details

#### Database Verification Patterns

```typescript
// Verify database record creation
const conversationAgents = await queryConversationAgents(
  electronApp,
  conversationId,
);
expect(conversationAgents).toHaveLength(1);

const agent = conversationAgents[0]!;
expect(agent.conversation_id).toBe(conversationId);
expect(agent.agent_id).toBe(testAgent.id);
expect(agent.is_active).toBe(1);
```

#### UI Verification Patterns

```typescript
// Verify agent appears in UI
await waitForAgentInConversationDisplay(window, testAgent.name);
await verifyAgentPillExists(window, testAgent.name);

// Verify modal behavior
await clickAddAgentButton(window);
await waitForAddAgentModal(window, true);
await selectAgentInModal(window, testAgent.name);
await waitForAddAgentModal(window, false);
```

#### Error Handling

- Include timeout handling for all async operations
- Provide descriptive error messages with test context
- Handle edge cases like network delays or UI loading states
- Ensure proper cleanup on test failures

## Technical Approach

### Test Isolation

- Each test starts with clean database state
- Settings state reset between tests
- Proper cleanup of all created data
- No dependencies between individual test scenarios

### Reliability Features

- Robust element selectors that handle UI changes
- Proper waiting for async operations
- Retry logic for flaky UI interactions
- Comprehensive error messages for debugging

### Performance Considerations

- Efficient setup that reuses existing patterns
- Minimal wait times while maintaining reliability
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Optimized database operations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ Test successfully completes full conversation agent creation workflow
- ✅ Database verification confirms conversation_agents records created correctly
- ✅ UI verification confirms agent pills display properly after addition
