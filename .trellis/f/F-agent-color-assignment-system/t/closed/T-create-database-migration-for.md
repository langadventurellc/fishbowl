  migrations/005_add_color_to_conversation_agents.sql: Created new database
    migration file to add color column to conversation_agents table with proper
    documentation and rollback instructions
log:
  - Successfully created database migration
    005_add_color_to_conversation_agents.sql that adds a color column to the
    conversation_agents table. The migration follows established patterns with
    proper documentation, includes rollback instructions, and sets a default
    value of '--agent-1' for backward compatibility. Migration uses TEXT type
    with NOT NULL constraint to store CSS variable references for agent color
    assignments. All quality checks pass and migration is ready for execution
    when desktop application starts.

## Context

This task implements the database schema changes needed for the Agent Color Assignment System. A new `color` column must be added to the `conversation_agents` table to store CSS variable references for persistent agent colors.

Reference: F-agent-color-assignment-system

## Specific Implementation Requirements

Create a new database migration file that adds a `color` column to the `conversation_agents` table with appropriate constraints and default values.

**File to Create:**

- `/migrations/005_add_color_to_conversation_agents.sql`

**Technical Approach:**

1. Follow existing migration patterns in `/migrations/` directory
2. Add `color` column with `TEXT` type, `NOT NULL` constraint
3. Set default value to `"--agent-1"` for simplicity
4. Include descriptive comments explaining the purpose and format
5. Add rollback instructions in comments

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

**Migration File Structure:**

- ✅ File named `005_add_color_to_conversation_agents.sql` in `/migrations/` directory
- ✅ Includes descriptive header comment explaining purpose
- ✅ Uses consistent SQL formatting with existing migrations
- ✅ Contains rollback instructions in comments

**Schema Changes:**

- ✅ Adds `color` column with `TEXT` data type
- ✅ Column has `NOT NULL` constraint
- ✅ Default value set to `"--agent-1"`
- ✅ Migration executes successfully on fresh database
- ✅ Migration executes successfully on existing database with data

**Documentation:**

- ✅ Comments explain CSS variable storage format
- ✅ Comments reference the 8-color palette (--agent-1 through --agent-8)
- ✅ Comments explain theme flexibility rationale

## Testing Requirements

**Manual Testing:**

- Run migration on fresh database and verify column exists
- Run migration on database with existing conversation_agents data
- Verify default value is applied to new column
- Verify existing data remains intact after migration

**Expected SQL Structure:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE conversation_agents ADD COLUMN color TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '--agent-1';
```

## Security Considerations

- No user input involved in this task
- Migration should be atomic and not expose sensitive data
- Default value should be safe for CSS variable usage

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundational task for the color system.

## Out of Scope

- TypeScript interface updates (handled in subsequent task)
- Application logic changes (handled in subsequent tasks)
- Testing framework updates
