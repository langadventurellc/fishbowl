    Successfully implemented complete delete functionality with confirmation
    dialog for message context menus. Key features:


    • **Confirmation Dialog**: Uses existing ConfirmationDialog component with
    destructive styling and proper messaging

    • **Database Integration**: Added missing messages.delete IPC channel,
    types, and handler using existing patterns

    • **State Management**: Integrated with useConfirmationDialog hook and
    automatic UI refresh after deletion

    • **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error handling throughout
    the delete flow

    • **User Experience**: Clear confirmation prompt with "Delete" action that
    cannot be undone warning


    The implementation follows all existing architectural patterns, passes
    quality checks, and provides a seamless delete experience with proper user
    confirmation and immediate UI updates.

# Implement Delete Functionality with Confirmation Dialog

## Context

Implement the functional delete behavior by integrating the message deletion service with the message context menu. This task provides working delete functionality with proper user confirmation and feedback.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create Confirmation Dialog Component

**File**: `apps/desktop/src/components/ui/ConfirmationDialog.tsx`

- Create reusable confirmation dialog component using existing UI patterns
- Research existing dialog/modal components in the project (shadcn/ui likely used)
- Include customizable title, message, and button text
- Support async confirmation with Promise-based API
- Ensure proper accessibility with focus management

### 2. Extend MainContentPanelDisplay Context Menu Handler

**File**: `apps/desktop/src/components/layout/MainContentPanelDisplay.tsx`

- Add delete action case to `onContextMenuAction` handler
- Integrate confirmation dialog before deletion
- Use message deletion service for database operations
- Update messages state after successful deletion

### 3. Integrate Delete Services

- Wire message deletion service into component context
- Connect confirmation dialog service for user prompts
- Follow existing service integration patterns

### 4. Handle Delete Operation Flow

- Implement complete delete workflow:
  1. User clicks "Delete message" from context menu
  2. Show confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to delete this message? This action cannot be undone."
  3. If confirmed, attempt message deletion from database
  4. Update UI to remove message from conversation display

### 5. State Management Integration

- Research existing message state management (likely Zustand store)
- Update message store to handle message removal
- Ensure UI updates reflect deletion immediately
- Handle optimistic updates with rollback on error

## Technical Approach

1. **Confirmation UX**: Clear, standard confirmation dialog with destructive action styling
2. **Database Operations**: Atomic deletion with proper transaction handling
3. **State Synchronization**: Immediate UI updates with database consistency
4. **Error Recovery**: Rollback UI changes if database operation fails
5. **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messaging for all outcomes

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Delete context menu action shows confirmation dialog
- ✅ Confirmed deletion removes message from database and UI
- ✅ Cancelled deletion leaves message unchanged
- ✅ Message list updates immediately after successful deletion
- ✅ Delete functionality includes comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ Integration with existing state management architecture
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- ✅ Delete operation completes within 500ms performance requirement

## Dependencies

- Requires message deletion service and database operations
- Requires regenerate removal for clean component interfaces

## Security Considerations

- **Authorization**: Validate user permissions before allowing deletion
- **Data Protection**: Ensure deleted messages are permanently removed
- **Confirmation Safety**: Prevent accidental deletions with clear confirmation
- **Input Validation**: Validate message IDs to prevent malicious deletion attempts

## Performance Requirements

- Delete operation completes within 500ms including confirmation
- UI updates are immediate and responsive
- Database operations don't block other functionality
- Confirmation dialog appears within 50ms of action trigger

## Out of Scope

- Do not implement copy functionality in this task
- Do not implement advanced deletion features (bulk delete, undo, etc.)
- Do not modify message relationship handling beyond basic requirements
- Copy operation integration is handled in separate task
