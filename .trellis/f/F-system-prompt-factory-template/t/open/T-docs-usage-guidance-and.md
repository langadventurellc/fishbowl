Context
Provide concise developer guidance for using the factory in shared code and verifying the desktop startup copy behavior locally.

References

- Feature spec
- Files added by prior tasks

Implementation Requirements

- Add a short README section or doc under `docs/` (e.g., `docs/architecture/system-prompt-factory.md`) covering:
  - How to construct `SystemPromptFactory` (constructor params)
  - Where the template file lives in the desktop app and how itâ€™s copied to user data
  - How to run unit tests for the shared module and the startup helper
  - Manual verification steps: check `app.getPath('userData')/system-prompts/system-prompt.txt` after starting the app in dev/test; packaged verification via artifact inspection
- Cross-link to the feature spec if appropriate

Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation file exists with clear, step-by-step guidance
- No contradictions with implementation

Security & Performance

- Avoid exposing local paths beyond userData path examples

Out of Scope

- Full user-facing documentation; this is developer-oriented
