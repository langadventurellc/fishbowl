log:
  - Successfully updated electron-builder configuration to include
    system-prompt.txt template in packaged desktop builds. The template file was
    moved from apps/desktop/ to the root resources/ folder to follow existing
    patterns and added to the extraResources configuration in
    apps/desktop/package.json. Validation confirmed the build system correctly
    finds and includes the file without errors.

Context
Ensure the system prompt template is bundled with the packaged Electron app so it can be copied to user data at startup.

References

- Feature spec: add to electron-builder `extraResources` in `apps/desktop/package.json`
- Current desktop packaging config in `apps/desktop/package.json`

Implementation Requirements

- Update `apps/desktop/package.json` build config to include `system-prompt.txt` as an extra resource.
  - Example (electron-builder):
    - `build.extraResources`: add entry for `system-prompt.txt` at project root of the desktop app
- Verify path correctness for dev vs packaged resolution in later task
- Add a lightweight doc comment in package.json (if allowed) or in commit/PR description describing why itâ€™s included

Acceptance Criteria

- Running a dry packaging config validation shows `system-prompt.txt` included (no actual build required per repo rules)
- Path does not inadvertently include extra files

Security & Performance

- Scope the pattern specifically to the one file to avoid shipping unintended resources

Out of Scope

- Startup copy logic (handled separately)
