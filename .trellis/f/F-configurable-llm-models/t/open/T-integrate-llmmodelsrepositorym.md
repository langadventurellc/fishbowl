## Context

Integrate the LlmModelsRepositoryManager into the main Electron application initialization process. This follows the exact pattern used for PersonalitiesRepositoryManager in `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts`.

The integration ensures the LLM models repository is initialized when the application starts, making it available throughout the application lifecycle.

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### 1. Add Repository Manager Initialization

In `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts`, find the section where PersonalitiesRepositoryManager is initialized (around line 177) and add LLM models repository initialization:

**Current Pattern:**

```typescript
const { personalitiesRepositoryManager } = await import(
  "../data/repositories/personalitiesRepositoryManager.js"
);
personalitiesRepositoryManager.initialize(userDataPath);
mainProcessServices?.logger?.info(
  "Personalities repository initialized successfully",
  { userDataPath },
);
```

**Add After Personalities:**

```typescript
const { llmModelsRepositoryManager } = await import(
  "../data/repositories/llmModelsRepositoryManager.js"
);
llmModelsRepositoryManager.initialize(userDataPath);
mainProcessServices?.logger?.info(
  "LLM models repository initialized successfully",
  { userDataPath },
);
```

### 2. Handle Initialization Errors

Follow the same error handling pattern as other repository initializations:

```typescript
try {
  const { llmModelsRepositoryManager } = await import(
    "../data/repositories/llmModelsRepositoryManager.js"
  );
  llmModelsRepositoryManager.initialize(userDataPath);
  mainProcessServices?.logger?.info(
    "LLM models repository initialized successfully",
    { userDataPath },
  );
} catch (error) {
  mainProcessServices?.logger?.error(
    "Failed to initialize LLM models repository",
    error as Error,
  );
  // Continue with application startup - repository will use fallback defaults
}
```

### 3. Verify Initialization Order

Ensure LLM models repository is initialized:

- **After** basic services are available (logger, userDataPath)
- **With** other repository managers (roles, personalities)
- **Before** main window creation and UI components
- **In the same try-catch block** as other repository initializations

## Technical Approach

1. **Find Existing Pattern**: Locate PersonalitiesRepositoryManager initialization
2. **Copy and Adapt**: Use exact same pattern for LLM models repository
3. **Maintain Error Handling**: Use consistent error handling approach
4. **Preserve Logging**: Follow same logging patterns for success and errors
5. **Test Integration**: Verify initialization occurs during application startup

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Initialization Requirements

- ✅ LlmModelsRepositoryManager.initialize() is called during application startup
- ✅ Repository is initialized with correct userDataPath parameter
- ✅ Initialization occurs before UI components are loaded
- ✅ Initialization is included in main.ts initialization sequence

### Error Handling Requirements

- ✅ Repository initialization errors are caught and logged
- ✅ Application continues startup even if repository initialization fails
- ✅ Error messages are clear and include context information
- ✅ Failed initialization allows fallback to default models

### Logging Requirements

- ✅ Successful initialization is logged with info level
- ✅ Failed initialization is logged with error level
- ✅ Log messages include relevant context (userDataPath)
- ✅ Log messages follow established format patterns

### Integration Requirements

- ✅ Repository manager is available throughout application lifecycle
- ✅ Other components can access repository through manager
- ✅ Initialization order doesn't break other application components
- ✅ Integration follows established patterns for consistency

### Testing Requirements

- ✅ Verify repository is initialized during application startup
- ✅ Test error handling for initialization failures
- ✅ Confirm log messages are generated correctly
- ✅ Test that UI components can access repository after initialization

## Dependencies

Requires T-create-llmmodelsrepositorymana for the repository manager implementation.

## Security Considerations

- **Error Isolation**: Repository initialization errors don't crash the application
- **Path Security**: userDataPath is properly validated and used
- **Access Control**: Repository is only accessible after proper initialization
- **Logging Security**: Error messages don't expose sensitive file system information

## Files Modified

- `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts` - Add repository manager initialization

## Integration Points

- Repository manager becomes available to other application components
- IPC handlers can access repository for LLM models operations
- UI components can use repository data through hooks and services
