## Context

Run comprehensive quality checks to verify that the entire feature implementation is working correctly. This includes building shared packages, running type checks, linting, and executing unit tests to ensure all changes integrate properly and meet quality standards.

**Related Feature**: F-remove-agent-defaults-and

## Implementation Requirements

### Primary Deliverables

1. **Build Shared Packages**
   - Run `pnpm build:libs` to rebuild shared packages with updated types and schemas
   - Verify shared packages build successfully without errors
   - Confirm apps can import from updated shared packages

2. **Run Quality Checks**
   - Execute `pnpm quality` to run all linting, formatting, and type checks
   - Resolve any issues found by quality checks
   - Ensure all TypeScript compilation succeeds

3. **Execute Unit Tests**
   - Run `pnpm test` to execute all unit tests
   - Verify all new unit tests pass
   - Confirm existing tests still pass after changes

4. **Manual Verification Testing**
   - Test agent creation flow without LLM parameters
   - Test personality configuration with 7 behaviors
   - Test settings navigation without defaults tab
   - Verify no broken UI elements or console errors

### Technical Approach

**Step 1: Rebuild Shared Packages**

```bash
# Rebuild shared packages to ensure types and schemas are available
pnpm build:libs
```

This is critical because apps import from `@fishbowl-ai/shared` and won't see type/schema changes until the shared package is rebuilt.

**Step 2: Run Quality Checks**

```bash
# Run comprehensive quality checks
pnpm quality

# Individual checks if needed:
pnpm lint
pnpm format
pnpm type-check
```

**Step 3: Execute Unit Tests**

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suites if needed:
pnpm test AgentsSection
pnpm test PersonalityForm
pnpm test agent.test.ts
```

**Step 4: Manual Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Open Settings modal, verify Agents section has no sub-tabs
- [ ] Click Agents in settings, verify no defaults tab appears
- [ ] Create new agent, verify no temperature/maxTokens/topP fields
- [ ] Edit existing agent, verify personality section shows 7 behaviors
- [ ] Test personality sliders for new behaviors (Response Length, Randomness, Focus)
- [ ] Save agent and verify new personality behaviors persist
- [ ] Verify no console errors or warnings

### Quality Standards Verification

**Build Requirements:**

- [ ] `pnpm build:libs` completes successfully
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors in shared packages
- [ ] Apps can import updated types from shared packages

**Code Quality Requirements:**

- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes with no errors or warnings
- [ ] `pnpm format` shows no formatting issues
- [ ] `pnpm type-check` passes with no TypeScript errors
- [ ] No unused imports or dead code warnings

**Testing Requirements:**

- [ ] All new unit tests pass
- [ ] All existing unit tests continue to pass
- [ ] Test coverage maintained for modified components
- [ ] No test failures or timeout issues

## Acceptance Criteria

### Build and Compilation

- [ ] Shared packages build successfully with `pnpm build:libs`
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- [ ] Apps can import updated types and schemas from shared packages
- [ ] No module resolution errors or import issues

### Code Quality

- [ ] ESLint passes without errors or warnings (`pnpm lint`)
- [ ] Prettier formatting is consistent (`pnpm format`)
- [ ] TypeScript type checking passes (`pnpm type-check`)
- [ ] Overall quality command succeeds (`pnpm quality`)

### Testing

- [ ] All unit tests pass (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] New unit tests for updated functionality pass
- [ ] Existing tests continue to pass after changes
- [ ] No test failures, timeouts, or instability

### Functional Verification

- [ ] Settings > Agents displays without defaults tab
- [ ] Agent creation form excludes LLM parameters
- [ ] Personality form displays 7 behavior sliders
- [ ] Agent creation/editing completes successfully
- [ ] New personality behaviors save and persist correctly

### User Interface

- [ ] No visual layout issues or broken components
- [ ] Settings navigation flows work correctly
- [ ] Forms maintain proper styling and responsiveness
- [ ] No console errors, warnings, or network issues

## Files to Monitor

**Build Outputs:**

- `packages/shared/dist/` - Verify shared package builds correctly
- `packages/ui-shared/dist/` - Verify UI shared package builds correctly

**Quality Check Results:**

- ESLint output for any warnings or errors
- TypeScript compilation output for type errors
- Test output for any failures or issues

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites**: All implementation tasks must be completed:

- T-remove-defaultstab-component
- T-simplify-agentssection
- T-remove-agents-subsections
- T-remove-llm-parameters-from
- T-add-three-new-personality
- T-update-agent-types-to-remove
- T-update-persistence-schemas-to
- T-update-agents-store-to-remove

**Blocks**: Feature completion and deployment readiness

## Security Considerations

**Security Testing**: Verify that removing LLM parameters doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities and that new personality behavior validation works correctly.

## Testing Strategy

**Automated Testing:**

- Build verification through shared package compilation
- Code quality verification through ESLint and TypeScript
- Unit test execution for all modified components

**Manual Testing:**

- End-to-end user flows for agent creation and editing
- Settings navigation and UI functionality
- Personality configuration with new behaviors

**Quality Commands:**

```bash
# Full quality verification sequence
pnpm build:libs
pnpm quality
pnpm test

# Individual verification if needed
pnpm type-check
pnpm lint
pnpm format
```

## Implementation Notes

- Run commands from project root directory
- Address any quality issues immediately
- Pay attention to shared package build - apps depend on it
- Test both agent creation and editing flows
- Verify personality behaviors work correctly with form state

## Success Criteria

1. **Build Success**: All packages build without errors
2. **Quality Pass**: All linting, formatting, and type checks pass
3. **Test Success**: All unit tests pass including new functionality
4. **Functional Verification**: Agent creation/editing works with new configuration
5. **UI Integrity**: Settings navigation and forms work without issues
6. **No Regressions**: Existing functionality continues to work correctly

This task ensures the entire feature implementation meets quality standards and functions correctly as an integrated system.
