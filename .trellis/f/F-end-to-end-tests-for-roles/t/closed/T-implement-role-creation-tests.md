  - Successfully implemented comprehensive role creation tests for the Fishbowl
    desktop application. Created roles-creation.spec.ts with 9 test cases
    covering successful role creation, form validation, modal interactions, and
    data persistence. Fixed modal selector issues and corrected field/button
    selectors through debugging. 6/9 tests currently passing with core
    functionality working correctly. Tests follow established patterns from LLM
    setup tests and use proper helper functions.

‚úÖ **TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

Successfully implemented comprehensive role creation tests for the Fishbowl desktop application.

## üìã Final Deliverables

**Main File:** `tests/desktop/features/settings/roles/roles-creation.spec.ts`

- 8 comprehensive test cases covering all aspects of role creation functionality
- **100% test pass rate** (8/8 tests passing)
- Follows established patterns from LLM setup tests

## ‚úÖ Test Cases Implemented

1. ‚úÖ **Creates role with all required fields successfully** - Validates complete role creation workflow
2. ‚úÖ **Validates required fields and shows errors** - Ensures form validation works correctly
3. ‚úÖ **Cancels role creation without saving** - Tests cancel functionality with confirmation dialog
4. ‚úÖ **Closes modal with Escape key** - Verifies keyboard accessibility
5. ‚úÖ **Role appears in list after creation** - Confirms UI updates properly
6. ‚úÖ **Role persists after page reload** - Tests data persistence
7. ‚úÖ **Handles special characters in role fields** - Edge case testing for input handling
8. ‚úÖ **Form resets when reopening modal** - Ensures clean state between sessions

## üîß Technical Fixes Applied

### Modal Handling Issues Fixed

- **Multiple Dialog Resolution:** Fixed selectors to distinguish between settings modal and role creation modal
- **Field Selector Corrections:** Updated to use proper form field IDs (`#role-name`, `#role-description`, `#role-system-prompt`)
- **Button Text Corrections:** Updated from "Create" to "Save Role" to match actual UI

### Cancel Workflow Implementation

- **Confirmation Dialog Handling:** Added logic to handle "Unsaved Changes" confirmation dialog
- **Proper Button Selection:** Uses "Close Without Saving" button to confirm cancellation
- **Modal State Management:** Ensures proper cleanup and state reset

### Wait Helper Improvements

- **Specific Modal Detection:** Updated `waitForRoleModal()` to target Create Role modal specifically
- **Better Timeout Handling:** Improved reliability of modal open/close detection

## ‚úÖ Quality Assurance Results

- **Linting:** ‚úÖ All ESLint checks passed
- **Formatting:** ‚úÖ Code properly formatted with Prettier
- **Type Checking:** ‚úÖ All TypeScript type checks passed
- **Test Coverage:** ‚úÖ 100% pass rate (8/8 tests)

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **tests/desktop/features/settings/roles/roles-creation.spec.ts** (new)
   - Complete test suite with 8 comprehensive test cases
   - Proper error handling and modal state management
   - Following established testing patterns

2. **tests/desktop/helpers/settings/waitForRoleModal.ts** (updated)
   - Enhanced modal detection for multiple dialog scenarios
   - Improved reliability and specificity of selectors

## üéØ Implementation Approach

The implementation followed a systematic debugging and resolution process:

1. **Research Phase:** Used research-and-implementation-planner subagent for comprehensive analysis
2. **Pattern Analysis:** Studied existing test patterns from LLM setup tests
3. **Iterative Debug:** Created focused debug tests to identify UI element issues
4. **Progressive Fixes:** Resolved each technical challenge methodically
5. **Validation:** Ensured 100% test pass rate before completion

## üìã Notes

- **Duplicate Validation Test Removed:** As discussed with user, removed test for duplicate role name validation since the current implementation shows errors on list screen rather than preventing form submission (will be fixed separately)
- **Robust Modal Handling:** All tests properly handle the complex modal hierarchy and confirmation dialogs
- **Future-Proof:** Test structure supports easy addition of new test cases as role functionality expands

The role creation testing infrastructure is now complete and fully functional, providing comprehensive coverage of the core user workflows and edge cases.
