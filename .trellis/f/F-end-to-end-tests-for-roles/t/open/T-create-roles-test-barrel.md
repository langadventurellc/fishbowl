# Create Roles Test Barrel Exports

Create the barrel export file (`index.ts`) for roles end-to-end test utilities, providing a clean import interface for all test suites.

## Context

- Feature: End-to-End Tests for Roles Section (`F-end-to-end-tests-for-roles`)
- Reference: `tests/desktop/helpers/index.ts` for export patterns
- Location: All exports are now centrally managed in `tests/desktop/helpers/index.ts`
- Purpose: All roles test utilities are exported from the main helpers barrel file

## Implementation Requirements

### Update `tests/desktop/helpers/index.ts`

Ensure all roles test utilities are properly exported from the main helpers barrel file:

**Export Categories:**

- Test suite setup utilities
- Navigation and wait helpers
- Mock data generators
- Storage cleanup utilities
- Helper function re-exports from parent directories

**Expected Export Structure:**

```typescript
// Types (if any custom types defined)
export type { MockRoleData } from "./createMockRoleData";

// Helper functions
export { cleanupRolesStorage } from "./cleanupRolesStorage";
export { createMockRoleData } from "./createMockRoleData";
export { openRolesSection } from "./openRolesSection";
export { waitForRolesList } from "./waitForRolesList";
export { setupRolesTestSuite } from "./setupRolesTestSuite";

// Re-export from helpers (if needed)
export { TestWindow, TestElectronApplication } from "../../../helpers";
```

### Import Convenience

Enable clean imports in test files:

```typescript
// Instead of multiple imports:
import { setupRolesTestSuite } from "./setupRolesTestSuite";
import { createMockRoleData } from "./createMockRoleData";
import { openRolesSection } from "./openRolesSection";

// Single import:
import {
  setupRolesTestSuite,
  createMockRoleData,
  openRolesSection,
  waitForRolesList,
} from "./index";
```

## Technical Details

### Export Organization

- Group related exports logically
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Re-export commonly needed types and utilities
- Follow TypeScript barrel export best practices

### Integration Points

- Used by all test suite files (\*.spec.ts)
- Should include all commonly used utilities
- May re-export from parent helper directories
- Maintains clean import statements in tests

### Dependencies on Infrastructure Tasks

- `setupRolesTestSuite` - Test suite infrastructure
- `cleanupRolesStorage` - Storage cleanup utilities
- `openRolesSection`, `waitForRolesList` - Navigation helpers
- `createMockRoleData` - Mock data generators

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `index.ts` file created with proper barrel exports
- [ ] All infrastructure utilities exported cleanly
- [ ] TypeScript types exported where applicable
- [ ] Re-exports from helpers included if needed
- [ ] Consistent with LLM setup export patterns
- [ ] Enables clean single-line imports in test files
- [ ] No circular import dependencies
- [ ] All exports properly typed
- [ ] Documentation comments for exported functions
- [ ] Future-ready for additional utilities

## Dependencies

- **Must wait for**: All infrastructure tasks to be completed
  - `T-create-roles-test-suite`
  - `T-create-roles-storage-cleanup`
  - `T-create-roles-navigation-and`
  - `T-create-roles-mock-data`
- Used by all test suite implementation tasks

## Files to Create

- Ensure `tests/desktop/helpers/index.ts` exports all roles utilities
- No new files needed - all exports centralized in main helpers barrel

## Integration Testing

- Verify all exports resolve correctly
- Test imports work in actual test files
- Ensure no missing or broken exports
